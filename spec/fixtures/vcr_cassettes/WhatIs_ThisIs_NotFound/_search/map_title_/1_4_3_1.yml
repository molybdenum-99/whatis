        Feige]] first publicly mentioned ''''Guardians of the Galaxy'''' as a potential
        film in 2010 and Marvel Studios announced it was in active development at
        the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in July 2012. Gunn was hired to

        -->\nIn 1988, following his mother''s death, a young [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]
        is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by [[Yondu|Yondu
        Udonta]]. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals an orb
        but is attacked by [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], a subordinate to the fanatical
        [[Kree]], [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]. Although Quill escapes with the orb,
        Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan
        sends the assassin [[Gamora]] after the orb.\n\nWhen Quill attempts to sell
        the orb on [[Xandar]], capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and
        steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically
        and cybernetically modified raccoon [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]], and the tree-like
        humanoid [[Groot]]. [[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them
        in the [[List of correctional facilities in comics#The Kyln|Kyln]]. A powerful
        inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to
        her association with Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that
        Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed
        Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb''s power. Learning that Gamora has
        a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape
        the Kyln in Quill''s ship, the ''''Milano''''.\n\nRonan meets with Gamora''s
        adoptive father, [[Thanos]], to discuss her betrayal. Quill''s group flee
        to [[Knowhere]], a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed
        head of a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while
        the rest of the group meet Gamora''s contact, the collector [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer
        Tivan]]. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stone]],
        an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings
        who wield it. Tivan''s tormented assistant Carina grabs the Stone, triggering
        an explosion that engulfs Tivan''s archive.\n\nRonan arrives and easily defeats
        Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan''s followers and Gamora''s
        adoptive sister [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. Nebula destroys Gamora''s ship,
        leaving her floating in space, and Ronan''s fighters capture the orb. Quill
        contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to
        survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten
        to attack Yondu''s ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising
        the orb to Yondu. Quill''s group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death,
        but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy.
        On Ronan''s flagship, the ''''Dark Aster'''', Ronan embeds the Stone in his
        warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to
        kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula
        allies with Ronan.\n\nThe Ravagers and Quill''s group join with the Nova Corps
        to confront the ''''Dark Aster'''' at Xandar, with Quill''s group breaching
        the ''''Dark Aster'''' with the ''''Milano''''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer
        to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Gamora fights and defeats Nebula, who then
        escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan''s power until
        Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the ''''Dark Aster''''. The damaged
        ''''Dark Aster'''' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to
        shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar,
        but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan''s warhammer.
        Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its
        burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.\n\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu
        into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real
        Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that
        it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their
        contract. Quill''s group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their
        criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his
        father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the
        last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her
        favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt ''''Milano'''' along with
        a sapling [[Cutting (plant)|cut]] from Groot.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]],
        Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits: a canine
        cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck.{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|Identified

        characters, including [[Andy Dwyer]] on the television series ''''[[Parks

        to portray fit characters in films such as ''''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''''

        role in action films after humbling auditions for ''''[[Star Trek (2009 film)|Star

        suggested Pratt to Gunn, who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast
        that role. Despite this, Finn arranged for a meeting between the two, at which
        point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role.
        Pratt also won over Feige, despite having gained weight again for ''''[[Delivery

        [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]''s ''''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008

        fiction,<ref name=\"Perlman3\" /> adding, \"I think [Marvel] were a little
        taken aback when I chose ''''Guardians'''', because there were ones that would
        make a lot more sense if you were a romantic-comedy writer or something like
        that.\" Perlman spent two years writing a draft, immersing herself in the
        ''''Guardians'''' universe, and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft,
        before Gunn was brought in<!--not a mistake--> in early 2012 to contribute
        to the script.<ref name=\"Perlman\" /> Gunn eventually rewrote the script
        entirely because \"it didn\u2019t work\" for him; he would use the film ''''[[The
        Dirty Dozen]]'''' as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel.<ref
        name=\"2014JulGunn\" /> Gunn later explained that Perlman''s draft was very
        different from the script he used during filming, including a different story,
        character arcs and no [[Walkman]]; he stated, \"In Nicole\u2019s script everything
        is pretty different\u2026 it''s not about the same stuff. But that''s how
        the [[Writers Guild of America, West|WGA]] works. They like first writers
        an awful lot.\"<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /> In August 2012, Marvel Studios
        hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman''s script,<ref name=\"2012AugMcCoy\"

        he did not receive production credit.<ref name=\"2013JulyMarvel\" />\n\nGunn
        revealed that character introductions were the \"hardest scenes to crack\",
        with [[Thanos]]'' introduction being the most difficult. He felt that \"having
        Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the [MCU] than it was to ''''Guardians
        of the Galaxy'''',\" yet he still wanted Thanos in the film, without \"[belittling]
        the actual antagonist of the film, which is Ronan.\" To solve his dilemma,
        Gunn chose to have Ronan kill \"The Other\", Thanos'' vizier, saying, \"I
        thought that was interesting, because we\u2019ve had the Other, who\u2019s
        obviously very powerful even in comparison to [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]],
        and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that
        was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it,

        /> By June 2013, [[Benicio del Toro]] was cast in the film, as part of a multi-film
        deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"2013MayDelToro\" /> Later in the month,
        it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey.<ref name=\"2013JuneReilly\"
        />\n\nSpecial effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts
        of actors, such as Bautista, to experiment with materials used to create the
        characters. White said, \"James always pushed for practical and makeup effects.
        He wanted, like me, to see the real deal there on set.\" White was careful
        not to use \"modern\" creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in
        Gunn''s uniquely envisioned world. White and his team created upwards of 1,000
        prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different-colored aliens.<ref
        name=\"WhiteMakeup\" /> For the specific aesthetic look to the film, Gunn
        wanted to create \"a colorful science-fiction world\", and include elements
        of 1950s and ''60s pulp movies, citing the Ravagers'' spaceships, which he
        compared to muscle cars, as an example of the latter.<ref name=\"GunnDesign\"
        /> Science fiction artist [[Chris Foss]] inspired and helped design the final
        look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film.<ref name=\"ChrisFoss\"

        United Kingdom,<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\" /> under the working title of
        ''''Full Tilt''''.<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg1\" /> Filming took place at
        Shepperton Studios and [[Longcross Studios]].<ref name=\"2013JanShepperton\"
        /><ref name=\"DavisInterview\" /> Later in July, Gunn and the film''s cast
        flew from London to attend San Diego Comic-Con International, where it was
        revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser, Gillan would be [[Nebula
        (comics)|Nebula]], del Toro as [[Collector (comics)|The Collector]], and that
        [[Djimon Hounsou]] had been cast as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]].<ref name=\"2013JulyComicCon\"

        Thanos would be a part of the film as the \"mastermind\".<ref name=\"2013JulyFeige\"
        /> On August 11, 2013, filming began at London''s [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium
        Bridge]],<ref name=\"Entertainmentwise\" /> which was selected as a double
        for [[Xandar]].<ref name=\"CBRSetVisit\" /> In August 2013, Marvel announced
        that [[Bradley Cooper]] would voice Rocket.<ref name=\"CooperOfficial\" />
        On September 3, 2013, Gunn said that filming was \"a little over half[way]\"
        complete.<ref name=\"2013SeptMTV\" /> Also in September, [[Vin Diesel]] stated
        that he was voicing Groot.<ref name=\"DieselConfirm\" /> However, Marvel did
        not confirm Diesel''s involvement in the film at the time.<ref name=\"RocketStandIn\"
        /><ref name=\"2013NovDelToro\" /><ref name=\"HuffingtonPostOct2013\" /> On
        October 12, 2013, Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed.<ref
        name=\"FilmingEnding\" />\n\n[[Director of photography]] [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben
        Davis]] used [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] cameras for the film, saying,
        \"I\u2019m traditionally a photochemical fan, but going with the digital format
        was the right way for this movie\u2026 the Alexa [provided] the right look
        for this particular film.\" During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis
        chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they
        \"had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [he] felt added something.\"
        Davis used spherical [[Panavision]] Primos for the rest of the film. Additionally,
        Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve
        the correct lighting looks for each scene.<ref name=\"DavisInterview\" />
        Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple
        times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without
        them in the shot.<ref name=\"DavisInterview2\" />\n\nGunn revealed that his
        brother, Sean Gunn, took on multiple roles during the filming process, such
        as standing in for Rocket, which he noted was beneficial for the other actors,
        including Saldana, Pratt, and Bautista, who responded positively to Sean and
        his on-set performances.<ref name=\"SeanGunnThanos\" /> Special effects makeup
        designer David White made two life-size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot
        as aids for visual effects, with White saying, \"it gives [the filmmakers]
        a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket
        can actually reach certain things or use certain devices.\"<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\"
        /> These busts were also used to see how the on-set lighting would affect
        the characters, to assist with the visual effects lighting process.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\"
        />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney revealed that the film came in \"slightly over
        the agreed budget\" at $232.3 million, with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4
        million from the British government.<ref name=\"ActualBudget\" /> It was previously
        estimated to have had a $170 million budget.<ref name=\"Tracking\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn
        November 2013, Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects
        as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during
        post-production, saying, \"Our sets are enormous. We have a prison that is
        350,000 pounds of steel. Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical
        and CGI effects\u2026 I can''t wait for people to see it, because it''s astonishingly
        beautiful.\"<ref name=\"GunnEffects\" /> After the release of ''''[[Thor:
        The Dark World]]'''', Feige stated that the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]]
        would be a focus in the film, as well as going forward into the [[List of
        Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Three|Phase Three]] slate of films within
        the MCU.<ref name=\"InfinityStones\" /> In a separate interview for ''''The
        Dark World'''' in November, Feige added that a third, unknown Infinity Stone
        would be seen in the film,<ref name=\"SlashFilmNov2013\" /> referred to as
        the \"Power Stone\" by the Collector.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /><ref name=\"IBPowerStone\"
        /> The [[mid-credits scene]] in ''''The Dark World'''' revealed Lovibond''s
        role as the Collector''s aide, later named Carina.<ref name=\"2014AprilLovibond\"
        /> In December 2013, Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot.<ref name=\"DieselMarvelOfficial\"
        />\n\nA few weeks of additional filming, involving the film''s main cast and
        crew, occurred in March 2014 at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney
        Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"GunnAddnlFilming\" /><ref
        name=\"GunnAddnlFilming2\" /><ref name=\"SaldanaAddnlFilming\" /> In April
        2014, Gunn described Thanos as the \"head of the snake\" in the film, and
        confirmed he would appear via performance capture.<ref name=\"SlashFilmApr2014\"
        /> In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an \"enormous\" amount
        of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt
        the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date.<ref
        name=\"IGNMay2014\" /> Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying,
        \"We really, really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy.
        We visit five planets, we see a hundred different races.\" The film introduces
        the alien race [[Planet Hulk|Sakaaran]], who act as Ronan''s mercenaries,
        as a replacement to the [[Badoon]], as the Badoon film rights belonged to
        [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"SuperheroHypePg3\" />\n\nBy the end of May,
        [[Josh Brolin]] was revealed as the voice of Thanos,<ref name=\"ThanosCast\"
        /><ref name=\"BrolinThanos\" /> with Feige confirming in July that Brolin
        also provided the performance capture for the character.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\"
        /> Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear
        in a scene with Ronan and Nebula.<ref name=\"VultureThanos\" /> In June 2014,
        Feige added that Thanos and his followers are \"the biggest piece of connective
        tissue that will eventually lead us back into ''''Avengers'''' films in the
        future.\"<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /> On casting Brolin, Feige said, <blockquote>We
        reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all
        the time but when it does it\u2019s very nice, where he was totally intrigued.
        He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London
        and learned about the characters a little bit. I spoke to him on the phone
        a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [Whedon] who
        loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of ''''Avengers''''. Then
        we shot him and recorded for it.<ref name=\"BrolinPerformance\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn
        July 7, 2014, Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on
        the film.<ref name=\"GotGComplete\" /> In August, regarding the post-credit
        scene, Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it
        was originally filmed, rather he was added during post-production,<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck\"
        /> a decision made by \"some combination of [Gunn] and the editor Fred Raskin\".<ref
        name=\"GunnHowardDuck2\" /> As the decision to add the character was made
        late in the post-production process, he had to be designed that day, before
        being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate.<ref name=\"GunnHowardDuck2\"
        /> Also in August, regarding the pre-credit scene of Groot dancing, Gunn stated
        that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators, and
        that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits, rather than
        during or after them, because of positive responses from a test audience,
        which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want \"people walking out
        and missing this thing\".<ref name=\"GrootDancing\" /> Marvel used design
        firm Sarofsky once again for the film''s title sequences, after liking their
        work for ''''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''''. Sarofsky developed
        a custom [[typeface]] based on the font used in the teaser posters for the
        opening credits, which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the
        film''s blue and grey imagery. One of the typography solutions offered before
        the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout
        the film.<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n{{multiple image\n<!--

        name=\"VFXShots\" /> which make up approximately 90% of the film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"
        /> The visual effects were created by: [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC), who
        worked on creating Groot, as well as Morag, Xandar, the ''''Dark Aster''''
        and the final battle on Xandar;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Framestore]], who
        worked on creating Rocket, extending the Kyln prison set and constructing
        Knowhere;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"FramestoreRocket\" /> [[Luma
        Pictures]], who worked on Thanos;<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> [[Method Studios]],
        who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers, as well as
        the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center;<ref name=\"FXGuide\"
        /> Lola VFX; Cantina Creative; [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], who worked on

        and Technicolor VFX.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /><ref name=\"MethodVFX\"
        /> Pre- and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor, with
        Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot.<ref name=\"FXGuide\"
        />\n\nProducer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian
        Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it provided references for lighting
        and on-set performances to the animators.<ref name=\"RocketGrootBI\" /> When
        creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in
        maintaining the character''s human qualities, as his face couldn''t move in
        the way that humans'' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained
        that, \"When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections\u2014trying
        to make these two irises not aimed at the same place\u2014trying to make them
        strange and look more human.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Textures for Groot
        came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden
        in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually,
        to simulate a muscle system for the character.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nOne
        of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur. Framestore''s
        Rachel Williams explained that, since \"raccoon fur is made up from a layer
        of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs\", these layers were
        separated and animated individually, removing the need to use \"guide hairs\"
        to control the movements of thick sections of fur.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />
        Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets, to ensure shots of Rocket
        at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore, and vice versa for when
        Groot was needed by the other studio.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nIn order
        to give Thanos \"the performance and the weight that he deserved\", Luma Pictures
        created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully
        CG character, using his \"eyes, some of his cheek, how his muscles move when
        he talks\". The character''s large jaw, and the deep groves that run down
        his face, had \"to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face.\"<ref
        name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main article|Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)}}\nIn
        August 2013, Gunn revealed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be composing the film''s
        score. Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that
        he can film to the music, as opposed to scoring to the film.<ref name=\"Bates\"
        /> In February 2014, Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from
        the 1960s and 1970s, such as \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\", on a mixtape in
        Quill''s [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the
        Earth, home, and family he lost.<ref name=\"TotalFilmTrailer6\" /> In May
        2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the ''60s and ''70s were \"cultural
        reference points\", saying, \"It\u2019s striking the balance throughout the
        whole movie, through something that is very unique, but also something that
        is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff
        is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [Quill]
        is a real person from planet Earth who\u2019s just like you and me. Except
        that he\u2019s in this big outer space adventure.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2014\"
        />\n\nWhen choosing the songs, Gunn revealed he \"started the process by reading
        the ''''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''' charts for all of the top hits
        of the ''70s\", downloading \"a few hundred\" songs that were \"semi-familiar\u2014ones
        you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head\" and
        creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He
        added that he \"would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house\u2014sometimes
        I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had
        a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing
        various songs, figuring out which would work the best.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"
        /> Most of the songs were played on set to help \"the actors and the camera
        operators find the perfect groove for the shot\", with [[David Bowie]]''s
        \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" the only song chosen and added during post-production.
        Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with \"Hooked on a Feeling\"
        in mind; however, once Gunn discovered \"[[Come and Get Your Love]]\", the
        song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a \"better fit.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"
        />\n\nThree albums were released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 29, 2014:
        The film''s score, ''''Guardians of the Galaxy (Original Score)'''', which
        features the music composed by Bates for the film;<ref name=\"Score\" /> ''''[[Guardians
        of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original
        Motion Picture Soundtrack)]]'''', which comprises the twelve songs from Quill''s
        mixtape; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\"
        /> By August 2014, the album which mirrored Quill''s mixtape had reached the
        top of the [[Billboard 200|''''Billboard'''' 200]] chart, becoming the first
        soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs
        to top the chart.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixChart\" /> Hollywood Records also released
        a cassette version of the ''''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'''' soundtrack on November
        28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants. The cassette,
        which is the first cassette [[Disney Music Group]] has released since 2003,

        making sure it''s spectacular and immersive without being silly, distracting,
        or overly showy.\" Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include
        shifting aspect ratios, to make the viewing experience \"even fuller and more

        were comparable to trailers for other superhero films like ''''[[Man of Steel

        noted that a different teaser was almost released \"that was very cheesy [and]
        sold the movie as something different than what it was\", as it tested better
        than the version that was ultimately released. Gunn credited the marketing

        with the other Guardians.<ref name=\"PreludeComic\" /> In June 2014, Mike
        Pasciullo, senior VP of Marvel Studios, described the marketing approach for
        ''''Guardians of the Galaxy'''' by saying that Marvel had \"built a robust
        marketing program for the theatrical release that carefully integrates traditional
        advertising, social media, digital marketing, strategic promotional partnerships,
        organic entertainment integrations [and] publicity.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\"

        tone,<ref name=\"ColliderEarlyReaction\" /><ref name=\"/FilmScreening\" />

        established characters making appearances.<ref name=\"/FilmScreening\" />\n\nOn
        July 12, 2014, Gunn and the actors from the film promoted ''''Guardians of

        the film.<ref name=\"MobileGame2\" /> On July 21, Pratt, Saldana, Bautista,
        Diesel and Cooper appeared on ''''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'''' to promote the film
        and debut some additional exclusive content.<ref name=\"KimmelPremiere\" />
        On July 29, Pratt and Saldana rang the opening bell of the [[New York Stock

        August 14, Marvel released the scene of Groot dancing,<ref name=\"BabyGroot\"
        /> which was shortly followed by an announcement from Funko that they were
        releasing a toy \"Dancing Groot\". ''''The Hollywood Reporter'''' noted that
        the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film''s theatrical
        release, along with the rush announcement from Funko, indicated the popularity
        of both the character and the scene.<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\" /> The scene
        also produced the word \"grooting\", coined by Michael Rooker, in which a
        person dances similar to Groot, with the word entering the social media [[lexicon]].<ref

        June 2012, Marvel filed eleven [[trademark]] applications for ''''Guardians

        hats.<ref name=\"2013AugVariety\" /> Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise

        charge of the collectibles.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\" /><ref name=\"2013AugVariety\"
        /> Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film,<ref name=\"LegoSets\"

        Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made
        by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\"
        /> Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits
        to licensees, Marvel used ''''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]''''{{''}}s
        success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to
        attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film''s potential breakout
        character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord''s
        obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his \"Awesome Mix Vo. 1\" cassette,
        has also served as a basis for tie-in products.<ref name=\"VarietyMarketingJun2014\"
        /> In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on \"Dancing Groot\",<ref name=\"THRBabyGroot\"
        /> while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing
        Groot, for release in December 2014.<ref name=\"KIDDancingGroot\" />\n\nIn
        December 2014, Disney made a second marketing push, to coincide with the film''s
        home media release with additional merchandise. Merchandise partners included:

        ThinkGeek with jewelry and watches; American Greetings with cards; Jay Franco
        with homegoods; and Vandor with drinkware. Additional partners included Mad
        Engine, Just Play, and Dragon Models. Paul Gitter, senior vice-president of
        Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said, \"The demand for ''''Guardians
        of the Galaxy'''' merchandise has been truly out of this world. Our merchandising

        when my old boss, the president of Troma Entertainment, @lloydkaufman, came
        to London to do a cameo in the film \u2013 as a prisoner in the Kyln. Lloyd
        taught me more than anyone else about making films. One of the things that
        keeps me sane in this business is staying true to my roots \u2013 whether
        with friends, family, or co-workers. As the world around me changes it''s
        nice to have some consistency in my personal life (even if that consistency
        is as crazy as @michael_rooker). Have a great day, folks! #guardiansofthegalaxy

        --> In ''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'''', the Guardians travel throughout
        the cosmos as they help [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]] learn more about his mysterious
        parentage.\n\nThe film was officially announced at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con
        International]] before the theatrical release of the first film, along with
        Gunn''s return from the first film, with the title of the sequel revealed
        a year later in June 2015. Principal photography began in February 2016 at
        [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in
        [[Fayette County, Georgia]], with many crew changes from the first film due
        to other commitments. Filming concluded in June 2016. Gunn chose to set the
        sequel shortly after the first film to explore the characters'' new roles
        as the Guardians, and to follow the storyline of Quill''s father established
        throughout that previous film. Russell was confirmed as Quill''s father in
        July 2016, portraying [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], a departure from Quill''s
        comic father.\n\n''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'''' premiered in Tokyo
        on April 10, 2017 and was released in the United States on May 5, 2017, in
        [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. It grossed more than $863&nbsp;million worldwide,
        making it the [[2017 in film|sixth highest-grossing film of 2017]], while
        also outgrossing its predecessor. The film received generally positive reviews,
        particularly for its visuals, soundtrack and cast, though critics deemed it
        not as \"fresh\" as the original. A sequel, ''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
        3'''', is being developed, with Gunn returning to write and direct, and is
        scheduled to be released in 2020.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per
        WP:FILMPLOT, plots are between 400 and 700 words only-->\nIn 2014, [[Star-Lord|Peter
        Quill]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], [[Rocket Raccoon|Rocket]],
        and [[Groot|Baby Groot]] are renowned as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008
        team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]], leader
        of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an
        inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora''s estranged sister [[Nebula
        (comics)|Nebula]], who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After
        Rocket steals some for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians'' ship
        with a fleet of drones. These are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the
        Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There this figure reveals himself
        as Quill''s father, [[Ego the Living Planet|Ego]], and invites Quill, Gamora,
        and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the
        ship and guard Nebula.\n\nAyesha hires [[Yondu|Yondu Udonta]] and his crew,
        who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for [[Human trafficking|child
        trafficking]], to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu
        hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant [[Taserface]]
        leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu
        aboard Yondu''s ship and executes Yondu''s loyalists. Nebula leaves to find
        and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their
        father, [[Thanos]]. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and [[Kraglin]],
        a remaining Yondu loyalist, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship
        and its crew as they escape, though not before Taserface warns the Sovereign.\n\nEgo,
        a god-like [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] that manipulated the matter around
        its consciousness to form this \"home\" planet, explains that it projected
        a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually
        falling in love with Quill''s mother [[Meredith Quill|Meredith]]. Ego hired
        Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith''s death, but the boy was
        never delivered and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches
        Quill to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego''s planet and tries
        to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover caverns
        filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he
        planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can [[terraform]] them into
        new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of
        two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu
        to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the
        Celestial power. Under Ego''s influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings,
        which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals
        that he killed Meredith due to the distraction she posed.\n\n[[Mantis (Marvel
        Comics)|Mantis]], Ego''s naive empath servant, grows close to Drax and warns
        him of Ego''s plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu,
        Groot and Kraglin arrive. As they come under attack from the Sovereign''s
        drones, the reunited Guardians find Ego''s brain at the planet''s core. Rocket
        makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain.
        Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough
        for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb then explodes, killing
        Ego and disintegrating the planet. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill,
        who realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate
        of Ego''s other progeny, and that Yondu was Quill''s true \"daddy\". Having
        reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and attempt to kill
        Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended
        by dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu''s sacrifice and accepting
        him as a Ravager again.\n\nIn a series of mid- and [[post-credit scene]]s,
        Kraglin takes up Yondu''s telekinetic arrow and control-fin; Ravager leader
        [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]] reunites with his ex-teammates; Groot starts

        film, and that his brother, [[Sean Gunn]], would return as Kraglin alongside
        [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]].<ref name=\"GillanSeanGunnConfirm\"
        /><ref name=\"GunnMar2015Q&A\" /> He also discussed his relationship with
        Marvel, explained that the company \"let me go and do my thing, and I truly
        listen to their notes and ideas. I''ve never been told to put in any character
        or plot element at all\u2026 When they trust you they give you a wide berth\u2026
        we just fit.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2015Q&A\" />\n\nIn May, Gunn said the sequel
        would feature fewer characters than the first film, and that he had planned
        to introduce two major new characters in the script\u2014[[Mantis (Marvel
        Comics)|Mantis]] and [[Adam Warlock]].<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /><ref
        name=\"AdamWarlock\" /> Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to
        portray Mantis,<ref name=\"GunnMay2015\" /> while he had decided to remove
        Warlock due to the film \"getting too busy\", explaining, \"one of the main
        things with ''''Guardians of the Galaxy'''' is not to add a bunch of characters,
        not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters\u2026
        and getting to know them more emotionally\u2026 everything is just getting
        too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies.\"<ref
        name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /> Gunn added, \"I adored what we had done with
        him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock.
        But it was one character too many and I didn''t want to lose Mantis and Mantis
        was more organically part of the movie anyway.\"<ref name=\"AdamWarlock\"
        /> He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered
        \"a pretty important part\" of the cosmic side of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref
        name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\" /><ref name=\"AdamWarlock\" /> The character''s
        future introduction is hinted at in one of the film''s mid-credits scenes.<ref
        name=\"WarlockCredits\" /> Gunn noted that Marvel gave him \"some blowback\"
        for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the
        character would be appearing in ''''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'''' and [[Untitled
        Avengers film|its sequel]], which was not the case. By including the scene,
        Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for
        fans that the character would not be seen in either Avengers film.<ref name=\"WarlockSceneBlowback\"
        />\n\n====Writing====\nAfter the film''s announcement, Gunn said he knew \"a
        lot of where I want to go [in the sequel]\",<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\"
        /> having written the backstory of Peter Quill, his father, and his history
        with Yondu during the making of the first film with the intention of exploring
        them in a future film.<ref name=\"GunnSet\" /> Gunn wanted to give the sequel
        a different structure from the first film, since \"one of the reasons people
        like ''''Guardians'''' is because it''s fresh and different, so the second
        one will be fresh and different from the first one.\"<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"
        /> Before starting on the script, Gunn hoped to further explore [[Drax the
        Destroyer]], Nebula, Kraglin, and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]], and
        expand on [[Xandar]]ian, [[Kree]], [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#K|Krylorian]],
        and Ravager culture.<ref name=\"GunnFilmDivider\" /><ref name=\"GunnEWNov2014\"
        /> He also hoped to introduce more female characters in the sequel, though
        wanted to avoid including \"earthlings\" such as [[Carol Danvers]],<ref name=\"ColliderFemaleCharacters\"
        /> as well as Novas [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]] or [[Nova (Sam
        Alexander)|Sam Alexander]], saying, \"I think Quill being the only earthling
        is important. That serves the entire movie-going audience and not just the
        handful of Nova [and Carol Danvers] fans.\"<ref name=\"GunnNova\" />\n\nFeige
        said exploring Quill''s father \"would certainly be part of a next Guardians
        adventure\u2026I think there''s a reason we seeded it at the very end of the
        [first] film like that.\"<ref name=\"FeigeQuillFather\" /> Gunn also stated
        that he wanted to make sure \"Yondu''s place in everything made sense\" in
        regards to his relationship to Quill and his father, and also revealed Quill''s
        father would not be [[J''son (comics)|J''son]] as in the comics.<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\"
        /> Gunn \"was less confident [Marvel] was going to buy in on Baby Groot than\"
        including [[Ego the Living Planet]], since \"adult Groot was the most popular
        character from the first film and I didn''t think they''d want to risk a good
        thing.\" However, by changing Groot, Gunn felt it \"opened the film up\" creatively,
        allowing Gunn to bring out \"new aspects of our other characters.\"<ref name=\"BabyGrootConfidence\"
        /> Gunn said [[Thanos]] would only appear in the sequel \"if he helps our
        story and he will not show up at all if not. Thanos is not the most important
        thing in ''''Guardians 2'''', that''s for damn sure. There''s the Guardians
        themselves and other threats the Guardians are going to be facing that are
        not Thanos.\"<ref name=\"EmpireAug2014\" /> Feige later confirmed that Thanos
        would not appear in the sequel, as he was being saved for a \"grander\" return.<ref
        name=\"FeigeThanos\" /><ref name=\"EmpireFeb2016\" /> When asked about how
        the film would connect with the other [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe
        films#Phase Three|Phase Three films]] in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn
        said, \"I don''t feel beholden to that stuff at all. I think it''s really
        about the Guardians and what they are doing.\"<ref name=\"GunnMTVNov2014\"
        />\n\nGunn set the film two-to-three months after the first film,<ref name=\"TimeFrame\"
        /><ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\" /> \"because he felt the group are just such
        fragile egos and he didn''t think this story could start years later.\"<ref
        name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\" /> Major planets visited in the film include Sovereign,
        [[List of planets in Marvel Comics#Berhart|Berhart]] and [[List of planets
        in Marvel Comics#Contraxia|Contraxia]]. Feige also stated two or three other
        worlds would be seen, as well as \"a little bit of Earth in this film, but
        it''s not these characters going to Earth.\"<ref name=\"ColliderFeb2017\"
        /> In December 2014, Gunn revealed the story for the film was written, saying,
        \"It''s [still] constantly shifting, but I feel like it''s pretty strong.
        I''m excited about it.\"<ref name=\"GunnCBRDec2014\" /> By early February
        2015, Gunn was \"a few short weeks\" away from submitting a full story treatment
        to Marvel, and said that when he first presented his idea for the sequel to
        the company they thought it was \"risky\". He described it as \"not really
        based on anything\" from the comics, being mainly an original story.<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"
        /><ref name=\"GunnFeb2015\" /> Gunn later referred to the full treatment as
        a \"scriptment\", \"a 70-page combination of a script and a treatment and
        it goes through every beat of the movie\".<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\"
        /> By April, he was preparing to write the screenplay,<ref name=\"GunnApril2015\"
        /> and in May he was hoping to complete the script before he began work on

        would not simply be ''''Guardians of the Galaxy 2''''.<ref name=\"GunnJune2015\"

        with a LOT of titles for ''''Vol. 2.'''' But because ''Guardians of the Galaxy''
        is already so wordy, it seemed strange to add another bunch of words after
        it. I liked ''''Vol. 2'''' the best, so that''s what I stuck on the cover
        of the screenplay\u2014and, fortunately, [Marvel] liked it.\"<ref name=\"GunnTitleExplain\"
        />\n\nIn September 2015, Gunn said in a [[Facebook]] post that he wanted to
        use [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#S|Sneepers]], an alien race that
        first appeared in Marvel Comics in 1964, as background characters in the film,
        but was advised against it by Marvel''s legal department because the name
        was too similar to [[wikt:sn\u00edpur|sn\u00edpur]], the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]
        word for [[clitoris]].<ref name=\"Sneeper\" /> The Marvel legal department
        later cleared the use of Sneepers in the film, in part because of all the
        media coverage Gunn''s initial post received.<ref name=\"SneepersOk\" /> At
        the end of the month, Feige stated casting announcements would be made \"over
        the next few months before the end of the year\",<ref name=\"FeigeSep2015\"
        /> and by the end of October, [[Pom Klementieff]] was cast as Mantis.<ref

        was offered the role of the film''s antagonist,<ref name=\"McConaughey\" />
        but had passed on it in favor of ''''[[The Dark Tower (2017 film)|The Dark

        /> while [[Kurt Russell]] entered early talks to play Quill''s father.<ref

        the first film, expressed interest in portraying the character again, despite

        explained that the Collector \"just didn''t fit\" into ''''Vol. 2''''.<ref

        to be in the film.<ref name=\"Agee\" />\n\n[[Property master|Prop master]]
        Russell Bobbitt had difficulty finding the cassette decks that had been used
        in the first film, and all of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]] headsets they sourced
        for the sequel were broken. Sony also did not have any headsets available
        for filming, while three pairs Bobbitt found on [[eBay]] cost around $1,800
        and were not the exact model. Bobbitt eventually created six from scratch
        for ''''Vol. 2''''. Other props he created for the film included two sets
        of blasters for Quill, with removable blaster cartridges, and \"steampunk-looking
        weapons and belts\" for the Ravagers;<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg3\" />
        Bobbitt explained that four different weapons were designed for the latter
        group, and then 15\u201320 versions of those were produced to be used by the
        various Ravager actors (there could be up to 85\u201395 Ravagers per scene).
        For their belts, the props team cut the leather themselves rather than buying
        existing belts, and then parts from different electronic devices such as radios
        and cell phones were glued together to make each belt \"a unique piece of
        art\". The prop department also made edible props for certain scenes: a prop
        of a [[stinkbug]]-inspired insect was made from chocolate and injected with
        black honey so it could be eaten on screen and \"when he bit down the honey
        poured out of his mouth\"; similarly, a \"yarrow root\" was designed based
        on enlarged images of pollen, and then created with non-dairy white chocolate
        to be eaten onscreen.<ref name=\"PressNotes\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\nPre-shooting
        began on February 11, 2016,<ref name=\"GunnPreShoot\" /> at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood
        Atlanta Studios|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref
        name=\"SHHypeMar2015\" /> under the working title ''''Level Up'''',<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"

        as [[production designer]].<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /><ref name=\"Braham\"
        /> Gunn noted that many of the crew from the first film, such as cinematographer
        [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] and production designer Charles
        Wood, signed on to work on ''''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'''',
        and due to a late change in production schedule for that film, were unable
        to work on ''''Vol. 2''''.<ref name=\"CrewChange\" /><ref name=\"VarietyGotGReview\"
        />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on February 17,<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"
        /> with Marvel confirming that Russell had joined the cast, and revealing
        that [[Elizabeth Debicki]] and [[Chris Sullivan (actor)|Chris Sullivan]] had
        also been cast, all in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\"
        /> The production used all 18 stages at Pinewood Atlanta, an increase in stage
        space from what was used for the first film. Gunn said the sequel required
        more sets than the first and \"our sets are very large, even though a lot
        of the film is CGI. I like to have as many practical sets as we can and make
        the environments as real as possible so it balances out the CGI elements.\"
        Despite this, Gunn noted that there were less locations featured in the sequel,
        with the focus instead on being more specific and detailed with the fewer
        places shown. Sets constructed for the film included: several for the Sovereign
        planet, for which Chambliss used a \"1950s pulp fiction variation on 1930s
        art deco design aesthetic\"; the Ravager''s main ship in the film, the ''''Eclector'''',
        which was constructed in sections to provide a complete 360-degree view of
        the ship as well as the ability to move sections around and portray different
        areas of the ship; and the Iron Lotus establishment on the \"pleasure planet\"
        of Contraxia, which Chambliss wanted to feel like it had been put together
        from \"a whole yard of repurposed junk where old spaceships are cast away
        and industrial materials that aren''t of use anymore are just left to rot\",
        creating a \"kind of neon jungle in its own way and covered in ice and snow.\"
        Interiors for other ships were also constructed, to limit the amount of [[chroma
        key|blue screen]] the actors had to interact with;<ref name=\"PressNotes\"
        /> this includes the cockpit of Quill''s ship that had been built for the
        first film before being stored in [[London]] which was transported to Atlanta
        for the sequel.<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\" />\n\n''''Vol. 2'''' was the
        first film to be shot with an [[8K resolution]] camera, the [[Red Digital
        Cinema Camera Company|Red]] Weapon 8K.<ref name=\"RedCamera\" /> Gunn had
        wanted to use a different camera than the [[Arri Alexa#Alexa 65|Alexa 65]]
        that had been used for several other Marvel films, because he found it to
        be a \"very big and heavy camera\". He wanted a camera that could deliver
        equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He
        eventually met with Red, whom he had a positive experience with working on
        ''''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'''', and they introduced
        him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided
        to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed,
        and spent months working with Red to get the camera ready for filming.<ref
        name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\" /> For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape
        from the Ravagers, a [[Phantom Cam]]era was used to film scenes up to 2000
        frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed
        within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up
        and choreographed.<ref name=\"VultureRavagersEscape\" /> Additional scenes
        were also shot in [[IMAX]] and its aspect ratio.<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017\"
        /> Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology
        he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called \"a [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]
        [[Tracking shot|dolly]]\" which allowed \"a spontaneity to the way the camera
        moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie.\" For filming
        the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video
        panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting
        no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed
        with the camera on a [[technocrane]], but any shots inside the cockpits again
        used the Stabileye which is \"so small that you can get it in there next to
        the actors\".<ref name=\"BrahamFilmmaker\" />\n\nIn April, Gunn stated that
        Reilly would not be part of the film, and that [[Glenn Close]] would be filming
        scenes to reprise her role of [[Nova Corps|Nova Prime Irani Rael]] from the
        first film, though it was unclear whether they would make it to the final
        cut of the sequel.<ref name=\"GunnSet\" /> He added that there were many other
        characters he could not include in the film due to rights issues, as [[20th
        Century Fox]] \"owns so many awesome cosmic villains and minor characters
        that I''d love to play around with\" such as [[Annihilus]] and [[Kang the
        Conqueror]].<ref name=\"GunnApr2016\" /> When filming [[Stan Lee]]''s cameo,
        Gunn also filmed two other cameos with Lee including one for ''''Doctor Strange,''''
        to limit the amount of travel Lee had to do.<ref name=\"GunnNoClose\" /><ref
        name=\"GunnCameos\" /> Additional filming for ''''Vol. 2'''' took place in
        [[Cartersville, Georgia]],<ref name=\"Cartersville\" /> [[List of Oregon state

        were revealed to be playing Ego, Quill''s father, and [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Ayesha]],
        respectively.<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\" /> [[Sylvester Stallone]] was also
        revealed to be in the film,<ref name=\"SDCC2016CBR\" /> with his role later
        revealed as [[Starhawk (comics)|Stakar Ogord]].<ref name=\"Stakar\" /> Gunn
        also introduced multiple actors who were playing Ravager characters, since
        the Ravagers have a larger presence in the film.<ref name=\"GunnSDCC2016Post\"
        /> On the decision to reveal Russell as Ego and Quill''s father when he did,
        Gunn felt that since \"people were going to figure it out eventually\u2026
        it was better that we took the reins in our own hands\" and make the reveal.
        Gunn also felt that this would move the focus of audiences from wanting to
        discover who Quill''s father is to \"the story and the relationship that these
        characters have\".<ref name=\"GunnEgoReveal\" /> In August 2016, Gunn confirmed
        the film would feature a [[post-credits scene]],<ref name=\"TimeFrame\" />
        later stating there would be five in total, with four mid-credits scenes and
        one post-credits.<ref name=\"5PostCreditScenes\" /><ref name=\"PostCreditsScenes\"
        /> Gunn also planned a sixth scene, where the Ravager Gef is found \"mortally
        wounded\" on the ship, but \"it ended up being a little confusing.\"<ref name=\"Gunn6thPostCredit\"
        />\n\nIn November, Gillan revealed that the film was undergoing reshoots.<ref
        name=\"GillanReshoots\" /> That February, it was reported that the film had
        scored a perfect 100 in [[test screening]]s, the highest for any Marvel Studios
        film. ''''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''' noted this score could not necessarily
        be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel''s specific testing process
        that selects its audience \"from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms
        ''friends and families screenings''\".<ref name=\"PerfectTestScreening\" />
        In March 2017, Gunn revealed that [[Michael Rosenbaum]] would appear in the
        film,<ref name=\"AdamCarollaPodcast\" /> and that Gunn would provide reference
        for Baby Groot''s dancing \"in a much bigger way [than the first film]. I
        actually had to do like a full day''s worth of dancing to get Groot''s dance
        down this time. Last time it was me in front of an [[iPhone]], and this time
        it''s me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different
        angles.\"<ref name=\"GunnGrootDancing\" /> [[Fred Raskin]] and [[Craig Wood
        (film editor)|Craig Wood]] returned from the first film to serve as editors.<ref
        name=\"MarvelFilmingBegins\" /> On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn
        said [[Nathan Fillion]], who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was
        going to appear as [[Wonder Man|Simon Williams]] in a sequence that would
        have shown several [[movie posters]] for films starring Williams, including
        films in which he portrays [[Arkon]] and [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]].<ref name=\"Fillion\"
        /><ref name=\"FillionLeak\" /> Gunn chose Williams for Fillion''s cameo because
        he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so didn''t
        want to give him a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial
        one later. Gunn still considered Fillion''s cameo canon to the MCU, despite
        it being cut.<ref name=\"Fillion2\" /> He also confirmed that Close''s scenes
        had been cut from the film, because it felt like he \"was trying to cram Nova

        for the film were created by [[Framestore]], [[Weta Digital]], Trixter, [[Method
        Studios]], [[Animal Logic]], [[Scanline VFX]], Lola VFX, Luma, and Cantina
        Creative.<ref name=\"GunnVFXVendors\" /> Previsualization was done by The
        Third Floor.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\" /> Framestore created 620 shots
        for the film, Weta Digital created 530, Method Studios more than 500, and
        Animal Logic created 147.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Framestore once again
        created Rocket and Groot,<ref name=\"THRVFX\" /><ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"
        /> with Method Studios, Weta Digital and Trixter also working on Rocket. Framestore
        rebuilt Rocket \"from the ground up\" for ''''Vol. 2'''', giving him an updated
        fur simulation, new facial shapes and phonemes, as well as a new eye rig,
        which came from a rig used for the character Gnarlack from ''''[[Fantastic
        Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''''.<ref
        name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Trixter''s work on Rocket included when he sets off
        a trap for the Ravagers, additionally working on the sequence when Rocket,
        Yondu and Kraglin jump across space.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Other work
        from Framestore included creatures, spaceships,<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\"
        /> Ayesha''s lair, the space chase, the ''''Eclector'''' scenes, and the adolescent
        Groot post-credit scene.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\nFramestore also
        created the film''s opening sequence.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Despite
        appearing as a single shot, it ultimately was composed of 11 different visual
        effect shots. Gunn provided reference video for Baby Groot''s dancing in the
        sequence.<ref name=\"OpeningSequence\" /> Framestore animation supervisor
        Arsland Elver noted that the majority of the opening sequence includes CGI
        and digital doubles, with three moments (Quill falling on the ground near
        Baby Groot, Gamora talking to Baby Groot, and Drax rolling behind Baby Groot)
        actually photography.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" /> As with the first film,
        Sarofsky created the typography for the opening, using the same style from
        ''''Guardians of the Galaxy'''' for consistency, \"this time in rusty gold
        and glowing blue neon\". Executive Creative Director Erin Sarofsky noted the
        challenge of placing the credits while the sequence was being refined by Framestore.
        Sarofsky proposed several different options for the credits, including having
        \"a little hovering character that projected a hologram up on the screen\",
        but Gunn did not want another character in the sequence to deal with. A simpler
        2D option was used instead. Sarofsky also worked on the end credits, the first
        time for the company, integrating the actual credits from company [[Exceptional
        Minds]] with designs inspired by old music album art, taking albums and scanning
        them for their old textures and scratches.<ref name=\"TitleSequence\" />\n\nThe
        destruction of the Ravager ship the ''''Eclector'''' was handled by Weta Digital.<ref
        name=\"WetaEclector\" /> Weta Digital also handled Ego during his fight with
        Quill, utilizing a digital double of Russell for many of their shots. Weta
        also needed to create a digital double for [[David Hasselhoff]] for the moment
        when Ego shifts into Hasselhoff''s guise. Guy Williams, Weta''s visual effects
        supervisor, said, \"We tried morphing to a live action Hoff \u2013 but it
        did not hold up as well. The Kurt version looked better than the Hoff version,..and
        while we had built a very detailed Kurt digi-double,- we didn''t want to go
        to the same level on the Hoff for just two shots. But in the end we did have
        to do a partial build digi-double of the Hoff. The reason we did the Kurt
        digi-double in the first place was to make sure all the effects stuck correctly
        to the body\u2026 so we went with the approach of a full digi-double, the
        hair, the side of the face everything on Kurt. For the Hoff, we got pretty
        close, but it is not quite as detailed as for Kurt.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide1\"
        /> Additional work by Weta included the inside of Ego''s planet, known as
        the Planet Hollow, which was inspired by the [[fractal art]] of Hal Tenny,
        who Gunn hired to help design Ego''s environment.<ref name=\"THRVFX\" /><ref
        name=\"EmpireMar2017\" /> Gunn added that there are \"over a trillion polygons
        on Ego''s planet,\" calling it \"the biggest visual effect of all time. There''s
        nothing even close to it.\"<ref name=\"EmpireMar2017\" />\n\nAnimal Logic
        and Method Studios also worked on the various parts of Ego''s planet, with
        Animal Logic focusing on Ego''s cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence
        and Baby Groot''s \"not that button\" sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal
        Logic''s work for Ego''s cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team
        at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film to work on the story
        vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings
        before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures
        that were used. Method also created the film''s final sequence for Yondu''s
        funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage
        of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts \"performing the scene for reference,
        studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition
        to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by\" Cooper. Additional work
        included the scenes on the planet Berhart.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Lola
        VFX worked on [[De-aging in film|de-aging]] Russell, having previously done
        similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including
        Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell''s performance
        in ''''[[Used Cars]]'''', as \"he had a lot of the [facial] action\" the visual
        effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, [[Aaron
        Schwartz (American actor)|Aaron Schwartz]], since he had \"big broad jaw,
        chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move[d] and crease[d] as
        he talk[ed]\", similar to Russell''s.<ref name=\"FXGuide1\" /> [[Laura Haddock]],
        reprising her role from the first film of [[Meredith Quill]] in the sequence,
        was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character.<ref
        name=\"58ThingsCommentary\" /> Luma worked on the Sovereign people and their
        world, and Adam Warlock''s cocoon.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main
        article|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (soundtrack)}}\nBy August 2014, Gunn
        had \"some ideas listed, but nothing for sure\" in terms of songs to include
        in Quill''s ''''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'''' mixtape,<ref name=\"VultureMusic\"
        /> for which he felt \"a little pressure for the soundtrack because so many
        people loved <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)|the

        that other stuff. But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"<ref

        and built them into the script,<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /> calling

        heard.\"<ref name=\"GunnSoundtrackDec2016\" /> [[Tyler Bates]] had returned
        to score the film by August 2015.<ref name=\"Bates\" /> As with ''''Guardians
        of the Galaxy'''', Bates wrote some of the score first so Gunn could film

        On October 19, a \"sneak peek\" teaser was released ahead of the first full

        not showing any of the new characters or relying on Baby Groot,<ref name=\"/FilmTeaser\"

        teaser trailer at [[Comic Con Experience]] 2016,<ref name=\"TrailerCCXP\"
        /><ref name=\"TrailerACCDebut\" /> he said that finding scenes and moments
        to showcase in the trailer without revealing too much of the film resulted
        in hard choices, since \"people really go through every single little shot

        in ''''Guardians 2''''.\"<ref name=\"FirstTeaserDone\" /> Describing the teaser
        trailer, Jacob Hall of [[/Film]] felt, \"It''s telling that this trailer can
        get away without actually selling the plot of the movie. Audiences didn''t
        fall in love with the first ''''Guardians of the Galaxy'''' because they were
        entranced by yet another Marvel Studios movie built around a villain who gets
        his hands on an Infinity Stone\u2026the bulk of this trailer is dedicated

        action-packed plot, dazzling visuals, and irreverent humor add up to a sequel
        that''s almost as fun\u2014if not quite as thrillingly fresh\u2014as its predecessor.\"<ref>{{cite

        of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November
        26, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 67 out of 100,
        based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite

        Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of \"A\"
        on an A+ to F scale.<ref name=\"DeadlineWknd1\" />\n\n[[Owen Gleiberman]]
        of ''''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''' called the film \"an extravagant
        and witty follow-up, made with the same friendly virtuosic dazzle\u2026 and
        just obligatory enough to be too much of a good thing.\" He cautioned that
        \"this time you can sense just how hard [Gunn] is working to entertain you.
        Maybe a little too hard.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Mike Ryan at ''''[[Uproxx]]''''
        noted the continued sense of humor and tone from the first film, and appreciated
        Gunn''s difference in overall structure in the sequel (which he compared to
        ''''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''''). Ryan was positive of the cast, particularly
        Rooker in his expanded role as \"the heart\" of the film.<ref name=\"UproxxReview\"
        /> Writing for ''''[[Rolling Stone]]'''', [[Peter Travers]] called the film
        a \"blast\" and gave it three stars out of four, praising the film for its
        tone and fun, soundtrack, and characters. He noted that \"''''Vol. 2'''' can''t
        match the sneak-attack surprise of its predecessor\u2026[but] the followup,
        while taking on some CGI bloat and sequel slickness, hasn''t lost its love
        for inspired lunacy.<ref name=\"RSReview\" /> ''''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''''{{''}}s
        [[Richard Roeper]] also gave the film three stars, writing, \"''''Guardians
        of the Galaxy Vol. 2'''' isn''t quite as much fun, not quite as clever, not
        quite as fresh as the original\u2014but it still packs a bright and shiny
        and sweet punch.\" Roeper continued that \"even with all the silliness and
        all the snarkiness, the Guardians can put a lump in your throat\", and praised
        the cast, especially Rooker, with \"one of the best roles in the movie\".<ref
        name=\"ChicagoReview\" />\n\nAt ''''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''', [[Todd
        McCarthy]] said \"''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'''' plays like a second
        ride on a roller-coaster that was a real kick the first time around but feels
        very been-there/done-that now.\"<ref name=\"THRReview\" /> Mara Reinstein
        of ''''[[Us Weekly]]'''' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, feeling
        \"excited audiences desperate for escapism [will] lap up the film''s inherent
        joyfulness\", but Gunn \"has doubled down on all his once-nifty novelties.
        Strip them away and what remains is a bloated semi-mess.\"<ref name=\"USWReview\"
        /> [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''''[[Los Angeles Times]]'''' was positive of
        the film''s soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying
        too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope
        of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, \"There are enough reminders
        of the first ''''Guardians'''' to make the sequel an acceptable experience,
        [but it''s] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production.\"<ref
        name=\"LAReview\" /> [[Manohla Dargis]] at ''''[[The New York Times]]''''
        said the film \"certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual
        rather than narrative.\" She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found
        many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing
        that with a much-needed \"unforced looseness\".<ref name=\"NYTReview\" />\n\n===

        story\" for ''''Vol. 2'''' while working on the first film, he also said he
        had ideas for a potential third film.<ref name=\"GotG3BasicStory\" /> Despite
        this, Gunn was unsure in June 2015 if he would be involved with a third ''''Guardians''''
        film, saying it would depend on his feelings after making ''''Vol. 2''''.<ref
        name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /> In April 2016, Feige said the future MCU films
        are \"still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond, but certainly I would say
        ''''Guardians 3'''' is [one film that''s] up there. I don''t know what exactly
        the order will be.\"<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016GotG3\" /> In March 2017, Gunn
        stated there would be a third film \"for sure. We''re trying to figure it
        out,\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\" /> also adding, \"There are no specific plans
        for ''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3''''. But we know unless something goes
        horribly\u2014which is always possible<!-- \"possibly\" in the source is a
        misprint, as one can clearly hear Gunn saying \"possible\" in the interview
        itself. Using \"sic\" here is problematic as we are attributing the quotation
        to Gunn, and it implies he misspoke. -->, you never know\u2014I think that
        Marvel would want to make another movie.\"<ref name=\"GunnMarch2017Yahoo\"
        /> He also reiterated he was still unsure if he would be involved with the
        film, and that he would figure out his involvement and his next project \"over
        the next couple of weeks.\"<ref name=\"GunnMar2017\" /> The following month,
        Gunn announced he would return to write and direct ''''Guardians of the Galaxy
        Vol. 3''''.<ref name=\"GunnVol3Confirm\" /> Klementieff is expected to reprise

        weeks back I told you how the Marvel legal department advised against using
        Sneeper as an alien species in Guardians of the Galaxy because the word is
        \"similar to the word meaning ''clitoris'' in Icelandic.\" Let it be known
        that I wasn''t protesting this decision, I just thought it was funny, so I
        shared it. But the Marvel legal folks are sweet people and, after all of the
        online articles about me not being able to use the term Sneeper, they came
        back and told me that maybe it''s not that big a deal after all: Sneeper is
        cleared for use. So keep an eye out for at least one Sneeper somewhere in

        2016|quote=Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 (April 28, 2017)... One thing it
        won''t have, though, is Josh Brolin''s Thanos, the Big Bad of the MCU, who
        was formally introduced in the first movie. \"I wouldn''t look too hard in
        that movie for Thanos,\" confirms Feige. So far, though, a being so apparently
        powerful he could wear the Avengers'' heads for hats has been curiously unthreatening,
        preferring to sit in space on what looks like a floating portapotty. Will
        that change? \"Are you asking if he''s going to do more than sit in a chair
        and smirk?\" laughs Feige. \"Oh, yes. The next time we see Thanos he will
        not be messing around. It will be, ''Oh, that''s why they''ve been teasing
        this villain for five years!''\"}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"RedCamera\">{{cite

        the show''s star, Ben Browder, a couple of years ago at the Saturn Awards,
        I asked him if he''d make a cameo in #guardiansofthegalaxy. He thankfully
        agreed and can be seen as the Sovereign Admiral with Ayesha. He''s a great
        guy. Here we are chatting Farscape #behindthescenes. #movies #movie #gotg

        inhabitants, the Celtic [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] tribe.{{Sfn|Margerison|2011|p=167}}
        The city''s name is not related to the [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Greek
        mythology]].\n\nParis is often referred to as The City of Light (''''La Ville
        Lumi\u00e8re''''),{{sfn|Robertson|2010|p=37}} both because of its leading
        role during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and more literally because Paris
        was one of the first European cities to adopt gas [[street light]]ing. In
        the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000
        gas lamps.{{sfn|Du Camp|1875|p=596}} Since the late 19th century, Paris has
        also been known as ''''Panam(e)'''' ({{IPA-fr|panam|pron}}) in [[argot|French
        slang]].{{sfn|Leclanche|1998|p=55}}\n\nInhabitants are known in English as
        \"Parisians\" and in French as ''''Parisiens'''' ({{IPA-fr|pa\u0281izj\u025b\u0303||Parisien2.ogg}}).
        They are also pejoratively called ''''Parigots'''' ({{IPA-fr|pa\u0281i\u0261o||Parigot.ogg}}).<ref
        group=\"note\">The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower
        popular class who spoke *argot*, then *parigot* was used in a provocative
        manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians
        in general.</ref>{{sfn|Dottin|1920|p=535}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main article|History

        the middle of the 3rd century BC.{{sfn|Arbois de Jubainville|Dottin|1889|p=132}}{{sfn|Cunliffe|2004|p=201}}
        One of the area''s major north-south trade routes crossed the Seine on the
        [[\u00eele de la Cit\u00e9]]; this meeting place of land and water trade routes
        gradually became a town and an important trading centre.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=25}}
        The Parisii traded with many river towns as far away as the Iberian Peninsula,
        and minted their own coins for that purpose.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=65\u201370}}\n[[File:ParisiiCoins.jpg|thumb|left|Gold

        after making the island a garrison camp, began extending their settlement
        in a more permanent way to Paris''s [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]]
        town was originally called [[Lutetia]] (more fully, ''''Lutetia Parisiorum'''',
        \"Lutetia of the Parisii\"). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths,
        temples, theatres, and an [[amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=154\u2013167}}\n\nBy
        the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as ''''Parisius'''',
        a Latin name that would later become ''''Paris'''' in French.{{Sfn|Meunier|2014|p=12}}
        [[Christianity]] was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint
        [[Denis]], the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused
        to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill
        which became known as ''''Mons Martyrum'''' (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later
        \"[[Montmartre]]\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city;
        the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine,
        the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], and many French Kings are buried there.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210\u201311}}\n\n[[Clovis
        I|Clovis the Frank]], the first king of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], made
        the city his capital from 508. A gradual immigration by the [[Franks]] also

        the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people
        moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, [[Bertrand
        Delano\u00eb]] became the first socialist mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort
        to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the [[V\u00e9lib'']], a system
        which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors. Bertrand
        Delano\u00eb also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank
        of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the [[Promenade des Berges
        de la Seine]], which he inaugurated in June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lemoniteur.fr/133-amenagement/article/actualite/21534070-les-berges-de-seine-rendues-aux-parisiens|title=Les

        of Paris]]|225x225px]]\n\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a
        few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king,
        emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy
        by the National Assembly until 1974.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}} The first modern
        elected mayor of Paris was [[Jacques Chirac]], elected 20 March 1977, becoming
        the city''s first mayor since 1793. The current mayor is [[Anne Hidalgo]],
        a socialist, elected 5 April 2014.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe mayor of Paris
        is [[indirect election|elected indirectly]] by Paris voters; the voters of
        each arrondissement elect the ''''[[Conseil de Paris]]'''' (Council of Paris),
        composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement has a number of members depending
        upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements
        (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected
        council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the
        most votes citywide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support
        of the majority of council members. Mayor [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]] (2001\u20132014)
        was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.\n\nOnce
        elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government;
        it meets only once a month. The current council is divided between a coalition
        of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and
        extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from
        smaller parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/politiques/Portal.lut?page_id=6731&elected_official_directory_id=-1&document_id=&portal_component=20&document_type_id=6&seq=0&actorlastname=&actorgender=&actormandate=&actorpoliticalgroupid=&actordistrictnumber=&detailed_search=Afficher+les+r%E9sultats|title=List

        and a directly elected council (''''conseil d''arrondissement''''), which,
        in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.{{sfn|Shales|2007|p=16}} The council
        of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and
        also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number
        of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population.
        There are a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=334}}\n\nThe
        budget of the city for 2013 was \u20ac7.6 billion, of which \u20ac5.4 billion
        went for city administration, while \u20ac2.2 billion went for investment.
        The largest part of the budget (38 percent) went for public housing and urbanism
        projects; 15 percent for roads and transport; 8 percent for schools (which
        are mostly financed by the state budget); 5 percent for parks and gardens;
        and 4 percent for culture. The main source of income for the city is direct
        taxes (35 percent), supplemented by a 13-percent real estate tax; 19 percent
        of the budget comes in a transfer from the national government.<ref>{{cite

        from 40,000 in 2000 to 73,000 in 2013. The city debt grew from \u20ac1.6 billion
        in 2000 to 3.1 billion in 2012, with a debt of \u20ac3.65 billion expected
        for 2014.<ref>''''Les Echos'''', 16 June 2014.</ref> As a result of the growing
        debt, the bond rating of the city was lowered from AAA to AA+ in both 2012
        and 2013. In September 2014, Mayor Hidalgo announced that the city would have
        budget shortfall of \u20ac400 million, largely because of a cut in support
        from the national government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economiematin.fr/news-municipales-hidalgo-augmentation-impot|title=Municipales

        addition of the ''''Bois de Boulogne'''', ''''Bois de Vincennes'''' and Paris
        heliport, Paris''s administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860.
        The [[Seine (department)|''''Seine d\u00e9partement'''']] had been governing
        Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban
        population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity. This problem
        was ''resolved'' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\"
        (Paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris
        became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided
        between the three departments surrounding it. The Paris region was renamed
        \"\u00cele-de-France\" in 1977, but the \"Paris region\" name is still commonly
        used today.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf|title

        Many other suburban residential districts (''''grands ensembles'''') were
        built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly

        1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high
        rent, the [[gentrification]] of many inner quarters, the transformation of
        living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The
        city''s population loss came to an end in the 21st century; the population

        the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration
        from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris
        has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian
        artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the
        16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and
        sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family
        commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French
        Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Girardon|Girardon]],
        [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations
        as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre
        Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]
        during this period. In 1648, the ''''[[Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et
        de sculpture]]'''' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established
        to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served
        as France''s top art school until 1793.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste

        times: [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Paul
        Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and others. The French Revolution and
        political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the
        capital. Paris was central to the development of [[Romanticism]] in art, with
        painters such as [[Gericault]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Impressionism]], [[Art
        Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Art
        Deco]] movements all evolved in Paris.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the late 19th
        century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris
        to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name
        for themselves.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]],

        [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]]
        and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Montmartre,
        painted his famous ''''[[Family of Saltimbanques|La Famille de Saltimbanques]]''''
        and ''''[[Les Demoiselles d''Avignon]]'''' between 1905 and 1907.<ref>''''Dictionnaire

        The work of [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] in the 1880s contributed considerably

        Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including
        [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], noted for his depictions of street scenes, [[Robert
        Doisneau]], noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among
        which ''''Le baiser de l''h\u00f4tel de ville'''' has become iconic of the

        industry, the home of some of the world''s best-known writers and poets, and
        the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books
        published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris
        did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th
        century, with authors such as [[Nicolas Boileau|Boileau]], [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]],
        [[La Fontaine]], [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], several coming

        [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Alexandre

        cuisine}}\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants
        and ''''[[haute cuisine]]'''', food meticulously prepared and artfully presented.
        A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of
        the [[Palais-Royal]] by [[Antoine Beauvilliers]]; it featured an elegant dining
        room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained
        waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant [[Le
        Grand V\u00e9four]] in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=1136\u20138}}
        The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Caf\u00e9
        de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the [[Caf\u00e9 Anglais]], [[Maison dor\u00e9e
        (Paris)|Maison Dor\u00e9e]] and the Caf\u00e9 Riche, were mostly located near
        the theatres on the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]; they were immortalised in
        the novels of Balzac and [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Several of the best-known restaurants
        in Paris today appeared during the ''''[[Belle Epoque]]'''', including [[Maxim''s
        Paris|Maxim''s]] on Rue Royale, [[Ledoyen]] in the gardens of the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]],
        and the [[Tour d''Argent]] on the Quai de la Tournelle.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}\n\nToday,
        due to Paris''s cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and
        almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has
        more than 9,000 restaurants.{{sfn|Domin\u00e9|2014}} The [[Michelin Guide]]
        has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest
        award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2015, of the 29
        Michelin three-star restaurants in France, nine are located in Paris. These
        include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as [[L''Ambroisie]]
        in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such
        as [[L''Astrance]], which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France''s
        most famous chefs, including [[Pierre Gagnaire]], [[Alain Ducasse]], [[Yannick
        All\u00e9no]] and [[Alain Passard]], have three-star restaurants in Paris.<ref>''''Le

        addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional
        eating places. The [[Coffeehouse|caf\u00e9]] arrived in Paris in the 17th
        century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th
        century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city''s political and cultural
        life. The [[Caf\u00e9 Procope]] on the Left Bank dates from this period. In
        the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially [[Caf\u00e9
        de la Rotonde]] and [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9]] in Montparnasse and [[Caf\u00e9
        de Flore]] and [[Les Deux Magots]] on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in
        business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}
        A ''''''[[bistro]]'''''' is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood
        restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial
        atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers
        who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in [[Russian language|Russian]],
        and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment.
        Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition
        from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}}
        A ''''''brasserie'''''' originally was a tavern located next to a brewery,
        which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition
        of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other
        beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the
        beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s,
        serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}\n\n===

        energy plants located near the outer limits of the [[Regions of France|region]];
        other energy sources include the [[Nogent Nuclear Power Plant|Nogent nuclear

        highest points of elevation.{{sfn|Burchell|1971|p=93}} From then on, the new
        reservoir system became Paris''s principal source of drinking water, and the

        created the [[Bois de Boulogne]], the [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]]
        and the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], located at the four points of the compass
        around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the
        Paris''s quarters.{{Sfn|Jarrass\u00e9|2007|pp=122\u2013161}} Since 1977, the
        city has created 166 new parks, most notably the [[Parc de la Villette]] (1987),
        [[Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn]] (1992), and [[Parc de Bercy]] (1997).{{Sfn|Jarrass\u00e9|2007|pp=242\u2013256}}
        One of the newest parks, the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] (2013),

        Paris.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Catacombs of Paris|Paris Catacombs]] hold the
        remains of approximately 6 million people|225x225px]]\nIn Paris''s Roman era,
        its main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the Left Bank settlement,
        but this changed with the rise of Catholicism, where most every inner-city
        church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris''s
        growth many of these, particularly the city''s largest cemetery, [[Holy Innocents''
        Cemetery|les Innocents]], were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary
        conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786,
        the contents of all Paris''s parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated
        section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris''s stone mines]] outside the \"Porte d''Enfer\"
        city gate, today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}}
        The process of moving bones from [[Holy Innocents'' Cemetery|Cimeti\u00e8re
        des Innocents]] to the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]] took place between
        1786 and 1814;{{sfn|Andia|Brialy|2001|p=221}} part of the network of tunnels
        and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\n\nAfter
        a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas
        Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in
        the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}}
        Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery|P\u00e8re
        Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]],
        and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]; these cemeteries became inner-city once
        again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much
        larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were
        created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the [[Saint-Ouen
        Cemetery|Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen]], the [[Cimeti\u00e8re parisien
        de Pantin]] (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de [[Pantin]]-[[Bobigny]]),
        the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d''[[Ivry-sur-Seine|Ivry]], and the Cimeti\u00e8re

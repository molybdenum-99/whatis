        of Berlin}}\n\n===Etymology===\nBerlin lies in northeastern Germany, east
        of the rivers [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]], which once constituted the eastern border
        of the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]]. While the Frankish Realm was primarily
        inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and
        the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]]
        tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany
        have [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical
        German place name endings of Slavic origin are ''''-ow'''', ''''-itz'''',
        ''''-itzsch'''' and ''''-in''''. The name Berlin has its roots in the language
        of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today''s Berlin,
        and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''''berl-''''/''''birl-''''
        (\"swamp\").<ref>{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische
        Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=3-411-06252-5}}</ref>
        There are many boroughs of Slavic origin in the city: Berlin-[[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]],
        Berlin-[[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], Berlin-[[Pankow]], Berlin-[[Spandau]]
        (earlier: ''''Spandow''''), Berlin-[[Gatow]], Berlin-[[Kladow]], Berlin-[[Steglitz]],
        Berlin-[[Lankwitz]], Berlin-[[Britz]], Berlin-[[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]],
        Berlin-[[Rudow]], Berlin-[[Alt-Treptow]], Berlin-[[Schm\u00f6ckwitz]], Berlin-[[Marzahn]],
        Berlin-[[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], and Berlin-[[K\u00f6penick]]. Since the ''''Ber-''''
        at the beginning sounds like the German word ''''B\u00e4r'''' (bear), a bear
        appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting

        Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to
        pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for
        most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the
        government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power

        0122.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography over central Berlin with [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]]]]\n\nBerlin
        is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands
        with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]]
        which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]].
        The ''''Berliner Urstromtal'''' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the
        low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]]
        to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of
        the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now.
        In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river
        [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course
        of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler
        See and the [[Gro\u00dfer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the
        upper Spree, which flows through the [[M\u00fcggelsee|Gro\u00dfer M\u00fcggelsee]]
        in eastern Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&spn=0.060339,0.085316&t=k&hl=en|title=Satellite

        parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of
        the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]]
        lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]],
        [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg]], and [[Neuk\u00f6lln]]
        lie on the Teltow Plateau.\n\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the
        Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the
        west of Berlin. Since 2015, the highest elevation in Berlin is found on the
        Arkenberge hills in Pankow, at {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Through the
        dumping of construction debris, they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{convert|120.1|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}),

        Berlin: [[Mitte]] area]]\n\nBerlin''s history has left the city with a [[polycentrism|polycentric
        organization]] and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings.
        The city''s appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played
        in Germany''s history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments
        based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the
        Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}}
        initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive
        style to the city''s architecture.\n\nBerlin was devastated by [[Bombing of
        Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World
        War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished
        in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition
        was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential
        or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of
        pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist
        dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important
        heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]],
        including the ''''Forum Fridericianum'''' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State
        Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the
        [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and
        the project to reconstruct the baroque fa\u00e7ades of the [[City Palace,
        Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical
        predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].\n\nClusters
        of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse
        locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]],
        the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin,
        respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century
        built upon the previous no-man''s land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three

        at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the
        European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible
        throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed
        from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here
        the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential
        buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this
        area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick
        architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring
        a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]]
        of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top
        of it.\n\n[[File:Brandenburger Tor abends.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Brandenburg
        Gate]], icon of Berlin and Germany]]\n\nThe [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic
        landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European
        history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional
        seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman
        Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome
        over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary
        proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\nThe [[East Side Gallery]]
        is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions
        of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city''s historical
        division.\n\nThe [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]
        square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous
        Gens d''armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by
        two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Franz\u00f6sischer Dom]] with its
        observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall),
        home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\n[[File:Museo

        and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin''s twelve boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]]
        ]]\n\nBerlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''''Bezirke'''').
        Each borough is made up by a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''''Ortsteile''''),
        which have historic roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation
        of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and
        incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with
        their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''''[[Kiez]]''''. At present, Berlin
        consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller
        residential areas or quarters.\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council
        (''''Bezirksamt'''') consisting of five councilors (''''Bezirksstadtr\u00e4te'''')
        including the borough''s mayor (''''Bezirksb\u00fcrgermeister''''). The council
        is elected by the borough assembly (''''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung'''').
        However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate
        to the Senate of Berlin. <!-- ([[urban district]], ''''Stadtkreis'''') -->
        The borough''s mayors make up the council of mayors (''''Rat der B\u00fcrgermeister''''),
        which is led by the city''s Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods
        have no local government bodies.\n\n===Twin towns \u2013 sister cities===\n{{See

        and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with
        its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin''s partnerships were canceled
        at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West
        Berlin''s partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level.
        During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power
        blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and
        East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its
        allies.\n\nThere are several joint projects with many other cities, such as
        [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]],
        [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]],
        [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international
        city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union,
        Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference
        of the World''s Major Cities, and Conference of the World''s Capital Cities.

        inhabitants, the Celtic [[Parisii (France)|Parisii]] tribe.{{Sfn|Margerison|2011|p=167}}
        The city''s name is not related to the [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] of [[Greek
        mythology]].\n\nParis is often referred to as The City of Light (''''La Ville
        Lumi\u00e8re''''),{{sfn|Robertson|2010|p=37}} both because of its leading
        role during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and more literally because Paris
        was one of the first European cities to adopt gas [[street light]]ing. In
        the 1860s, the boulevards and streets of Paris were illuminated by 56,000
        gas lamps.{{sfn|Du Camp|1875|p=596}} Since the late 19th century, Paris has
        also been known as ''''Panam(e)'''' ({{IPA-fr|panam|pron}}) in [[argot|French

        One of the area''s major north-south trade routes crossed the Seine on the
        [[\u00eele de la Cit\u00e9]]; this meeting place of land and water trade routes
        gradually became a town and an important trading centre.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gondrand|2010|p=25}}
        The Parisii traded with many river towns as far away as the Iberian Peninsula,
        and minted their own coins for that purpose.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=65\u201370}}\n[[File:ParisiiCoins.jpg|thumb|left|Gold

        after making the island a garrison camp, began extending their settlement
        in a more permanent way to Paris''s [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]]
        town was originally called [[Lutetia]] (more fully, ''''Lutetia Parisiorum'''',
        \"Lutetia of the Parisii\"). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths,
        temples, theatres, and an [[amphitheatre]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=154\u2013167}}\n\nBy
        the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as ''''Parisius'''',
        a Latin name that would later become ''''Paris'''' in French.{{Sfn|Meunier|2014|p=12}}
        [[Christianity]] was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint
        [[Denis]], the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused
        to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill
        which became known as ''''Mons Martyrum'''' (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later
        \"[[Montmartre]]\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city;
        the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine,
        the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], and many French Kings are buried there.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009|pp=210\u201311}}\n\n[[Clovis
        I|Clovis the Frank]], the first king of the [[Merovingian dynasty]], made
        the city his capital from 508. A gradual immigration by the [[Franks]] also

        The [[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]], the royal residence, was located at the western
        end of the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9. In 1163, during the reign of [[Louis
        VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Maurice de Sully]], bishop of Paris, undertook
        the construction of the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] at its
        eastern extremity.\n\nParis'' cultural centre had begun to move to the Right
        Bank, after the draining of its former swampland made the land habitable and
        fit for crops. In 1137, a new city marketplace (where [[Les Halles]] is today)
        replaced the two smaller ones on the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]] and Place
        de la Gr\u00e8ve (Hotel de Ville).{{sfn|John Frederick Hinnebusch|1972|p=262}}
        The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris'' river trade corporation,
        an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later
        years), Paris'' first municipal government.\n\nIn the late 12th century, [[Philip
        II of France|Philip Augustus]] extended the [[Louvre]] fortress to defend
        the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls
        between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island,
        and paved its main thoroughfares.{{sfn|Sarmant|2012|pp=36\u201340}} In 1190,

        the city''s first mayor since 1793. The current mayor is [[Anne Hidalgo]],
        a socialist, elected 5 April 2014.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nThe mayor of Paris
        is [[indirect election|elected indirectly]] by Paris voters; the voters of
        each arrondissement elect the ''''[[Conseil de Paris]]'''' (Council of Paris),
        composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement has a number of members depending
        upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements
        (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected
        council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the
        most votes citywide is not selected if the other candidate has won the support
        of the majority of council members. Mayor [[Bertrand Delano\u00eb]] (2001\u20132014)
        was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.\n\nOnce
        elected, the council plays a largely passive role in the city government;
        it meets only once a month. The current council is divided between a coalition
        of the left of 91 members, including the socialists, communists, greens, and
        extreme left; and 71 members for the centre right, plus a few members from
        smaller parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/politiques/Portal.lut?page_id=6731&elected_official_directory_id=-1&document_id=&portal_component=20&document_type_id=6&seq=0&actorlastname=&actorgender=&actormandate=&actorpoliticalgroupid=&actordistrictnumber=&detailed_search=Afficher+les+r%E9sultats|title=List

        The largest part of the budget (38 percent) went for public housing and urbanism
        projects; 15 percent for roads and transport; 8 percent for schools (which
        are mostly financed by the state budget); 5 percent for parks and gardens;
        and 4 percent for culture. The main source of income for the city is direct
        taxes (35 percent), supplemented by a 13-percent real estate tax; 19 percent

        addition of the ''''Bois de Boulogne'''', ''''Bois de Vincennes'''' and Paris
        heliport, Paris''s administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860.
        The [[Seine (department)|''''Seine d\u00e9partement'''']] had been governing
        Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban
        population had made it difficult to govern as a unique entity. This problem
        was ''resolved'' when its parent \"District de la r\u00e9gion parisienne\"
        (Paris region) was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris
        became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided
        between the three departments surrounding it. The Paris region was renamed
        \"\u00cele-de-France\" in 1977, but the \"Paris region\" name is still commonly
        used today.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.driea.ile-de-france.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Chapitre5_de_Breve_histoire_de_amenagement_de_Paris_DREIF_Auteur_Claude_Cottour_cle0344bc.pdf|title

        disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular,
        became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration''s growth. [[Paul Delouvrier]]
        promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs ''''m\u00e9sentente'''' when he became

        Many other suburban residential districts (''''grands ensembles'''') were
        built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly
        expanding population:{{sfn|Castells|1983|p=75}} these districts were socially

        1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high
        rent, the [[gentrification]] of many inner quarters, the transformation of
        living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The
        city''s population loss came to an end in the 21st century; the population

        the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration
        from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, Paris
        has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".{{sfn|Montclos|2003}} Italian
        artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the
        16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and
        sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family
        commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the [[French
        Baroque and Classicism]] era. Sculptors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Girardon|Girardon]],
        [[Antoine Coysevox|Coysevox]] and [[Nicolas Coustou|Coustou]] acquired reputations
        as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. [[Pierre
        Mignard]] became the first painter to King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]
        during this period. In 1648, the ''''[[Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et
        de sculpture]]'''' (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established
        to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served
        as France''s top art school until 1793.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}}\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste

        and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the

        times: [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Paul
        Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and others. The French Revolution and
        political and social change in France had a profound influence on art in the
        capital. Paris was central to the development of [[Romanticism]] in art, with
        painters such as [[Gericault]].{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} [[Impressionism]], [[Art
        Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[Art
        Deco]] movements all evolved in Paris.{{sfn|Michelin|2011}} In the late 19th
        century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris
        to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name
        for themselves.{{sfn|Perry|1995|p=19}} Artists such as [[Pablo Picasso]],

        [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]]
        and many others became associated with Paris. Picasso, living in Montmartre,
        painted his famous ''''[[Family of Saltimbanques|La Famille de Saltimbanques]]''''
        and ''''[[Les Demoiselles d''Avignon]]'''' between 1905 and 1907.<ref>''''Dictionnaire
        historique de Paris'''', p. 68</ref> Montmartre and [[Montparnasse]] became
        centres for artistic production.\n\nThe most prestigious names of French and
        foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era, are
        [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi]] ([[Statue of Liberty]] - ''''Liberty

        The work of [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] in the 1880s contributed considerably
        to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central

        industry, the home of some of the world''s best-known writers and poets, and
        the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books
        published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris
        did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th

        [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Alexandre

        cuisine}}\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants
        and ''''[[haute cuisine]]'''', food meticulously prepared and artfully presented.
        A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of
        the [[Palais-Royal]] by [[Antoine Beauvilliers]]; it featured an elegant dining
        room, an extensive menu, linen tablecloths, a large wine list and well-trained
        waiters; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant [[Le
        Grand V\u00e9four]] in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|pp=1136\u20138}}
        The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Caf\u00e9
        de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the [[Caf\u00e9 Anglais]], [[Maison dor\u00e9e
        (Paris)|Maison Dor\u00e9e]] and the Caf\u00e9 Riche, were mostly located near
        the theatres on the [[Boulevard des Italiens]]; they were immortalised in
        the novels of Balzac and [[\u00c9mile Zola]]. Several of the best-known restaurants
        in Paris today appeared during the ''''[[Belle Epoque]]'''', including [[Maxim''s
        Paris|Maxim''s]] on Rue Royale, [[Ledoyen]] in the gardens of the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]],
        and the [[Tour d''Argent]] on the Quai de la Tournelle.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}\n\nToday,
        due to Paris''s cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and
        almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has
        more than 9,000 restaurants.{{sfn|Domin\u00e9|2014}} The [[Michelin Guide]]
        has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest
        award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2015, of the 29
        Michelin three-star restaurants in France, nine are located in Paris. These
        include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as [[L''Ambroisie]]
        in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such
        as [[L''Astrance]], which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France''s
        most famous chefs, including [[Pierre Gagnaire]], [[Alain Ducasse]], [[Yannick
        All\u00e9no]] and [[Alain Passard]], have three-star restaurants in Paris.<ref>''''Le

        addition to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional
        eating places. The [[Coffeehouse|caf\u00e9]] arrived in Paris in the 17th
        century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th
        century Parisian caf\u00e9s were centres of the city''s political and cultural
        life. The [[Caf\u00e9 Procope]] on the Left Bank dates from this period. In
        the 20th century, the caf\u00e9s of the Left Bank, especially [[Caf\u00e9
        de la Rotonde]] and [[Le D\u00f4me Caf\u00e9]] in Montparnasse and [[Caf\u00e9
        de Flore]] and [[Les Deux Magots]] on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in
        business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=1137}}
        A ''''''[[bistro]]'''''' is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood
        restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial
        atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers
        who occupied the city; \"bistro\" means \"quickly\" in [[Russian language|Russian]],
        and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment.
        Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition
        from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=715}}
        A ''''''brasserie'''''' originally was a tavern located next to a brewery,
        which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition
        of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other
        beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the
        beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like caf\u00e9s,
        serve food and drinks throughout the day.{{sfn|Fierro|1996|p=773}}\n\n===

        from vehicles.{{sfn|Hart|2004|p=355}} Cyclists have also been given the right
        to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a [[community

        From 1857, the civil engineer [[Eug\u00e8ne Belgrand]], under [[Napoleon III]],
        oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from
        locations all around the city to several reservoirs built atop the Capital''s
        highest points of elevation.{{sfn|Burchell|1971|p=93}} From then on, the new
        reservoir system became Paris''s principal source of drinking water, and the
        remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs,
        were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris''s streets. This system is

        the city''s first director of parks and gardens, [[Jean-Charles Alphand]],
        created the [[Bois de Boulogne]], the [[Bois de Vincennes]], [[Parc Montsouris]]
        and the [[Parc des Buttes-Chaumont]], located at the four points of the compass
        around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the
        Paris''s quarters.{{Sfn|Jarrass\u00e9|2007|pp=122\u2013161}} Since 1977, the
        city has created 166 new parks, most notably the [[Parc de la Villette]] (1987),
        [[Parc Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn]] (1992), and [[Parc de Bercy]] (1997).{{Sfn|Jarrass\u00e9|2007|pp=242\u2013256}}
        One of the newest parks, the [[Promenade des Berges de la Seine]] (2013),
        built on a former highway on the Left Bank of the Seine between the Pont de
        l''Alma and the [[Mus\u00e9e d''Orsay]], has floating gardens and gives a

        Paris.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Catacombs of Paris|Paris Catacombs]] hold the
        remains of approximately 6 million people|225x225px]]\nIn Paris''s Roman era,
        its main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the Left Bank settlement,
        but this changed with the rise of Catholicism, where most every inner-city
        church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris''s
        growth many of these, particularly the city''s largest cemetery, [[Holy Innocents''
        Cemetery|les Innocents]], were filled to overflowing, creating quite unsanitary
        conditions for the capital. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786,
        the contents of all Paris''s parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated
        section of [[Mines of Paris|Paris''s stone mines]] outside the \"Porte d''Enfer\"
        city gate, today [[place Denfert-Rochereau]] in the 14th arrondissement.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=101}}{{sfn|Broadwell|2007|p=92}}
        The process of moving bones from [[Holy Innocents'' Cemetery|Cimeti\u00e8re
        des Innocents]] to the [[Catacombs of Paris|catacombs]] took place between
        1786 and 1814;{{sfn|Andia|Brialy|2001|p=221}} part of the network of tunnels
        and remains can be visited today on the official tour of the catacombs.\n\nAfter
        a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas
        Frochot under [[Napoleon]] Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in
        the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.{{sfn|Ayers|2004|p=271}}
        Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery|P\u00e8re
        Lachaise]], [[Montmartre Cemetery|Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Montparnasse]],
        and later [[Passy Cemetery|Passy]]; these cemeteries became inner-city once
        again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much
        larger ring of suburban fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were
        created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the [[Saint-Ouen
        Cemetery|Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Saint-Ouen]], the [[Cimeti\u00e8re parisien
        de Pantin]] (also known as Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de [[Pantin]]-[[Bobigny]]),
        the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien d''[[Ivry-sur-Seine|Ivry]], and the Cimeti\u00e8re

        Hill]]]]\nThere is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome
        area from approximately 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger
        debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.<ref name=\"Heiken, G. 2005\"/>
        Evidence of stone tools, pottery and stone weapons attest to about 10,000
        years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew
        from [[pastoralism|pastoral]] settlements on the [[Palatine Hill]] built above
        the area of the future [[Roman Forum]].  Between the end of the [[bronze age]]
        and the beginning of the [[Iron age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitol
        was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since
        the end of the 14th century BC).<ref name=coa9>Coarelli (1984) p. 9</ref>
        However, none of them had yet an urban quality.<ref name=coa9/> Nowadays,
        there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation
        (\"[[synoecism]]\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above
        the Palatine.<ref name=coa9/> This aggregation was facilitated by the increase
        of agricultural productivity above the [[Subsistence economy|subsistence level]],
        which also allowed the establishment of [[secondary sector|secondary]] and
        [[tertiary sector|tertiary activities]]. These in turn boosted the development
        of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly [[Ischia]] and
        [[Cumae]]).<ref name=coa9/> These developments, which according to archaeological
        evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as
        the \"birth\" of the city.<ref name=coa9/> Despite recent excavations at the
        Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of
        the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe

        of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats:
        the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]],
        and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower
        class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers
        and the establishment of large slave estates provoked the migration to the
        city of a large number of people. The continuous warfare made necessary a
        professional army, which was more loyal to its generals than to the republic.
        Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first
        century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed
        attempt of social reform of the populares [[Tiberius Gracchus|Tiberius]] and
        [[Gaius Gracchus]],<ref name=awg89>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964), p.89</ref>

        of [[Gaul]] made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a [[Caesar''s
        Civil War|second civil war]] against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory,
        Caesar established himself as [[Dictator perpetuo|dictator for life]].<ref
        name=awg91/> His assassination led to a [[second Triumvirate]] among [[Octavian]]
        (Caesar''s grandnephew and heir), [[Mark Antony]] and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus
        (triumvir)|Lepidus]], and to [[Final War of the Roman Republic|another civil
        war]] between Octavian and Antony.<ref name=awg93>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964),

        and got the title of [[Augustus]], founding the [[principate]], a [[diarchy]]
        between the ''''princeps'''' and the senate.<ref name=awg93/> Rome was established
        as a [[de facto]] empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second
        century under the Emperor [[Trajan]]. Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]],
        i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been given
        in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire saw as
        rulers, emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],<ref name=awg97>Hermann
        & Hilgemann (1964), p.97</ref> [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built

        dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.<ref name=awg99>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964), p.99</ref>
        This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion,
        preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century
        (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire
        and beyond.<ref name=awg107>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964), p.107</ref> The Antonine
        age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the
        [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]]
        to [[Egypt]].<ref name=awg99/>\n\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|right|The

        the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235 the Empire entered into 50-year period
        known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous
        putsches by generals who sought to secure the region of the empire they were
        entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was
        the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her
        father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some
        regions - Britain, Spain and North Africa - were hardly affected. Instability
        caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as
        the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic
        tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated
        incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather
        than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] in the East
        invaded several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.<ref
        name=awg101>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964), p.101</ref>\n\nEmperor [[Diocletian]]
        (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and
        introduced the so-called [[dominate]] which tried to give the impression of
        absolute power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention
        of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax
        demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the
        State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation
        he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized
        the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was
        governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted
        from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin
        Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie,
        Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served
        as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the
        process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth civilian administration
        and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties
        and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt
        to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian
        ruled the eastern half (with residence in [[Nicomedia]]). In 296 he elevated
        [[Maximian]] as ''''Augustus'''' of the western half where he ruled mostly
        from [[Mediolanum]] (Current day Milan) when not on the move.<ref name=awg101/>
        In 292 he created two ''junior'' emeperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus,
        Constantius for Britain, Gaul and Spain whose see was in Trier and Licinius
        in Srimium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian
        tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in
        305 Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed to colleagues for themselves.<ref
        name=awg101/> After the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a
        series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power during the
        years 306-313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine called the Great undertook
        a major reform of the bureaucracy not by changing the structure but by rationalizing
        the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325-330 after
        he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East at the end of 324.The so-called
        [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a Letter from Licinius to
        the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone
        including to Christians and ordered the restoration of confiscated church
        properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded
        the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators
        in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored
        in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence,
        which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence
        like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by
        Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].<ref name=awg103>Hermann & Hilgemann (1964),
        p.103</ref> The creation of Constantinople would have a profound effect on
        Europe: it was the bulwark against invasion and conquest from the East for
        1000 years.\n[[File:Constantine Chiaramonti Inv1749.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.7|right|Bust
        of Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], 4th century]]\nChristianity
        in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire
        in 380. It was issued in the name of the three emperors - called the [[Edict
        of Thessalonica]] - by Gratian, Valentinian II and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]],
        who was clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a
        unified empire: after his death in 395 his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius
        (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]]
        and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the
        Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the siege of Milan
        in 402. During the 5th century the emperors form the 430s mostly resided in
        the capital, Rome.<ref name=awg103/>\n\nRome, which had lost its central role
        in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]]
        by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],<ref name=awg115>Hermann & Hilgemann
        (1964), p.115</ref> but very little physical damage was done, most of which
        was repaired.   The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such
        as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population
        of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450-500,000 by the time the city was
        sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].<ref name=awg117>Hermann
        & Hilgemann (1964), p.117</ref> The weak emperors of the fifth century could
        not stop the decay, until the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August
        476 marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the
        beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=awg103/> The decline of the city''s
        population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from
        440 on, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations
        to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even
        so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine,
        and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege
        of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired
        in 443 (according to \"Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present\",
        Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179).
        However the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay. Population
        declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no
        certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped
        to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.  (\"Rome,
        Profile of a City\": 321-1308, Richard Krautheimer, p.&nbsp;165.) However,
        the city gave an appearance of shabbiness. The population decline coincided
        with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the 5th and 6th centuries
        with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members
        of society continued right through the 6th century and probably prevented
        the population from falling further (\"Rome, Urban History\", pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185.)
        The figure of 500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed
        to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of 5lbs per person,
        enough for 145,000 inhabitants. (Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III).\n\n===Middle

        important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of

        In 729, the Lombard king [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] donated

        of several popes, and of [[Crescentius the Younger|Crescentius]], a powerful

        the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the
        cardinals, and a reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind
        this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under
        the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture
        Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].<ref

        by the [[Normans]] of [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support
        of the Pope, who was besieged in Castel S. Angelo.<ref name=be20/>\n\nDuring
        this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''''senatore'''' or ''''patrizio'''':
        in the 12th century. This administration, as often in the Italian cities,
        evolved into the [[Medieval commune|commune]], a new form of social organisation,
        expression of the new wealthy classes.<ref name=be20/> Pope [[Lucius II]]
        had already to fight against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued
        by his successor [[pope Eugenius III]]: then the commune, allied with the
        nobility, was supported by [[Arnaldo da Brescia]], a monk who was a religious
        and social reformer.<ref name=be21>Bertarelli (1925), p.21</ref> After the

        pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[western Schism]] (1377\u20131418),
        and during the next forty years, the city was prey of the fights which shattered
        the church.<ref name=be22/>\n\n===Early modern===\n{{Main article|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Ponte

        1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman
        pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.<ref name=be22/>\nThis brought to Rome a century
        of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].<ref
        name=be22/> The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from
        [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist
        and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral
        and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo
        X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted
        their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City, to the power
        of their stock{{clarify|date=August 2017}}, and to the patronage of the arts.<ref
        name=be22/>\n\nDuring those years the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]]
        moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter''s Basilica|Saint
        Peter''s Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''''[[Ponte Sisto]]'''' (the
        first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on
        Roman foundation) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the
        best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]],
        [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro
        Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n[[File:Engelsburg und Engelsbr\u00fccke

        secluded himself]]\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with
        many Popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]].
        The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects
        led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn,
        the [[Counter-Reformation]]. [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], for example,
        was well known for his decadence, extravagance and immoral life.<ref>{{cite

        and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music,
        literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other
        major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts,
        learning and architecture.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] period changed Rome''s face
        dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]
        by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached
        the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and
        his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]],

        this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in
        the world. The old St. Peter''s Basilica built by Emperor [[Constantine the
        Great]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13369b.htm |work=Catholic

        dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists
        like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro
        Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple
        of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the
        [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most
        famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the
        [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael''s Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo
        started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the
        famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II. Rome lost in part
        its religious character, becoming increasingly a true Renaissance city, with
        a great number of popular feasts, horse races, parties, intrigues and licentious
        episodes.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers,
        including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of
        arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the
        preservation of the ancient ruins. The fight between France and Spain in Europe
        caused the first plunder of the city in less than five hundred years after
        [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]. In 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of
        Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked
        the city]], putting to an abrupt end the golden age of the Renaissance in
        Rome.<ref name=be22/>\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the
        Church began the Counter-Reformation as an answer to the Reformation, a large-scale
        questioning of the Church''s authority on spiritual matters and governmental
        affairs. (This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from
        the Church.)<ref name=be22/> Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus
        V]], Rome became the centre of the reformed Catholicism and saw the instalment
        of new monuments which celebrated the papacy''s restored greatness.<ref name=be23>Bertarelli
        (1925), p.23</ref> The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries
        continued the movement by having the city''s landscape enriched with baroque
        buildings.<ref name=be23/>\n\nThis was another nepotistic age: the new noble
        families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi
        family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]],
        [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes,
        who built for their relatives huge baroque buildings.<ref name=be23/> During
        the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached also the Eternal City, where
        the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people''s welfare.<ref
        name=be22/> But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation.
        There were setbacks in the attempts to restrain the anti-Church policies of
        European powers of the time, the most notable setback perhaps being in 1773
        when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression
        of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].<ref name=be22/>\n\n===Late
        modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived
        [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was
        built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The Papal States were
        restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]''s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed
        as a ''''D\u00e9partement'''']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]:
        first as ''''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'''' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''''D\u00e9partement
        Rome'''' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Church State under
        the pope was reinstated through the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn
        1849 [[Roman Republic (19th century)|another Roman Republic]] arose within
        the framework of the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Two of the most influential
        figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe
        Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n[[File:Breccia di Porta
        Pia Ademollo.jpg|left|thumb|Italian soldiers [[Capture of Rome|enter Rome]]
        on 20 September 1870]]\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification,
        as the rest of Italy was reunited as the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with a temporary
        capital at [[Florence]]. In 1861 Rome was declared capital of Italy even though
        it was still under the Pope''s control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges
        of the [[Papal States]] were under French protection, thanks to the foreign
        policy of [[Napoleon III]]. It was only when this was lifted in 1870, owing
        to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], that Italian troops were able
        to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near
        [[Porta Pia]]. Afterwards, [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself as [[prisoner
        in the Vatican]], and in 1871 the capital of Italy was finally moved from
        Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm

        World War I, Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]], led by [[Benito
        Mussolini]], who [[March on Rome|marched on the city]] in 1922, eventually
        declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy
        with [[Nazi Germany]]. Mussolini pulled down large parts of the city centre
        in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate
        the fascist regime and the resurgence of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini

        The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city''s population, which surpassed
        one million inhabitants. In World War II, due to its art treasuries and the
        presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other
        European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San
        Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American
        forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of
        which another 1,500 died. After [[25 Luglio|the fall of Mussolini]] and the
        [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] on 8 September 1943, the city
        was occupied by the Germans and declared an [[open city]] until [[Liberation
        of Rome#Breakout|its liberation on 4 June 1944]].\n\nRome developed momentously
        after the war, as one of the driving forces behind the \"[[Italian economic
        miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and
        early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''''la dolce vita'''' (\"the
        sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films
        such as ''''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'''', ''''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo
        Vadis]]'''', ''''[[Roman Holiday]]'''' and ''''[[La Dolce Vita]]'''' filmed
        in the city''s iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in
        population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''''comune'''' had
        more than 2.8 million residents. After that, population started to decline
        slowly as inhabitants began to move to nearby suburbs of Rome.\n\n==Government==\n{{See

        largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''''comuni''''
        of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the ''''comune''''
        is the ''''Palazzo Senatorio'''' on the [[Capitoline Hill]], the historic
        seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly
        referred to as ''''\"Campidoglio\"'''', the Italian name of the hill.\n\n====Administrative
        and historical subdivisions====\n[[File:Roma - Municipi numerata.png|thumb|The
        ''''municipi'''' of Rome]]\nSince 1972 the city has been divided into administrative
        areas, called ''''municipi''''  (sing. ''''municipio'''') (until 2001 named
        ''''circoscrizioni'''').<ref>{{cite web|title=Territorio |publisher=Comune

        They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation
        in the city. Each ''''municipio'''' is governed by a president and a council
        of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years.
        The ''''municipi'''' frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative
        divisions of the city.<br> The municipi were originally 20, then 19.<ref>In
        1992 after a [[referendum]] the XIX Circoscrizione became the ''''[[Comune]]''''

        divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre
        is divided into 22 ''''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'''', all of which are located
        within the [[Aurelian Walls]] except [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]].\n\nThese
        originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]],
        which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval
        rioni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The
        \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref>
        In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number
        of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict
        XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral,
        and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870,
        when Rome became the third capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital
        led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within
        and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874 a fifteenth rione,
        [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised
        zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century
        other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside
        the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative
        subdivisions of the city the name \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni
        are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with
        the ''''historical city'''' (''''Centro Storico'''').\n\n===Metropolitan and
        regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City
        of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced
        the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city''s metropolitan
        area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]].  The Metropolitan
        City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its
        dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city
        is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale

        now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome
        is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian
        Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President
        of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime
        Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian
        Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional
        Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread
        out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which
        is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome
        is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}})
        river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside
        the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The
        Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian
        Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]],
        the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed
        by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the
        historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}}
        inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore,
        where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The
        altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above
        mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]])
        to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak

        The ''''Comune'''' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}},
        including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of

        City - April 2007.jpg|thumb|Panorama of Rome from the dome of [[St. Peter''s
        Basilica]]]]\n\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city
        were considered to be the area within the city\u2019s  walls. Originally,
        these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after
        the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline
        and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the
        [[Servian Wall]], but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years
        later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian
        Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls
        the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] had
        to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city''s urban area is cut in two
        by its ring-road, the ''''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'''' (\"GRA\"), finished
        in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}.
        Although when the ring was completed most part of the inhabited area lay inside
        it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]],
        which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been
        built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''''comune''''
        covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''''Raccordo''''
        and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and
        [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities.
        It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable
        neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the
        density of the ''''comune'''' is not that high, its territory being divided
        between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]],
        and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main article|Climate of Rome}}\nRome

        also created a large number of suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn mid-2010,

        of St. John Lateran HD.jpg|thumb|right|[[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran|Papal
        Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], Rome''s Cathedral]]\nMuch like the rest
        of Italy, Rome is predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and the
        city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries,
        the base of the ancient Roman Religion with the [[Pontifex Maximus|pontifex
        maximus]] and later the seat of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the pope. Before
        the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio
        Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the
        city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were
        [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]],
        god of war, and father of Rome''s twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according
        to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]
        and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults,
        such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]]
        and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first
        Christians began to arrive, Rome became [[Christian]], and the [[Old St. Peter''s
        Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as
        the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home
        of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise
        known as the Pope.\n[[File:Moschea 00497.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mosque of Rome]],
        the largest mosque in Western Europe]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home
        to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter''s Basilica, Rome''s cathedral is the
        [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]], located to the south-east of the city-centre.
        There are around 900 churches in Rome in total, aside from the cathedral itself,
        some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the
        [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]],
        [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of
        the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath
        the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are
        also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical
        Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical
        Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been a significant growth
        in Rome''s [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North African
        and Middle Eastern countries into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason=
        How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result
        of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the
        ''''comune'''' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the
        largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], that was designed by architect [[Paolo
        Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the Roman Republic,
        Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli,
        p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman
        Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''''[[Great Synagogue
        of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main article|Vatican
        City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of
        St. Peter''s Square|[[St. Peter''s Square]] in Vatican City.}}\nThe territory
        of Vatican City is part of the ''''Mons Vaticanus'''' ([[Vatican Hill]]),
        and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter''s Basilica]],
        the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built,
        along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]]
        of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city
        on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected
        by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded
        by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]]/[[Pope Pius
        IV|Pius IV]]/[[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]]
        of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries
        of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was
        all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was
        no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary,
        and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.\n\nThe
        territory includes [[Saint Peter''s Square]], separated from the territory
        of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders
        Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter''s Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]],
        which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter''s. This grand approach was designed
        by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, for want
        of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion
        of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the [[Lateran Treaty]], certain [[properties
        of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace
        of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status
        similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===Pilgrimage===\n[[File:Petersdom

        Peter''s Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome
        has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from
        all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome,
        the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the
        Middle Ages. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the [[Middle Ages]]
        and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]
        starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in
        800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during
        the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and \"holy city\"
        for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to
        [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last
        resting place of St. Peter.\n\nPilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to a
        large number of sites, both within the Vatican City and in Italian territory.
        A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate''s stairs]]: these are,
        according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]]
        of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during
        his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/14/wsteps114.xml
        Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory], ''''Daily Telegraph'''', Malcolm
        Moore, 14 June 2007</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena
        of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the ''''Scala
        Santa'''' has attracted Christian pilgrims who wished to honour the Passion
        of Jesus. Object of pilgrimage are also several catacombs built in the Roman
        age, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during
        periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi
        dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell''Anima]]), or churches associated with
        individual religious orders, such as the Jesuit Churches of Jesus and Sant''Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally,
        pilgrims in Rome and Roman citizens thanking God for a grace should visit
        by foot the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le
        sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each pilgrim in the
        Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The
        seven churches are the four major Basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter
        in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa
        Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]]
        (a palaeochristian Basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded
        by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments
        of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]]
        (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano|Roman
        catacombs]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in

        architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the
        Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome
        was for a period one of the world''s main epicentres of classical architecture,
        developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref

        architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also
        widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main
        centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and neoclassic architecture.<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient
        Rome====\n{{Main article|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne
        of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]]
        ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators,
        it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and
        sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the
        [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan''s Column]], [[Trajan''s Market]], the
        [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]],
        [[Castel Sant''Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]],
        the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della
        Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city,
        situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end
        of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still
        remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]]
        e include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica
        of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter
        largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD
        mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found
        in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]],
        and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the
        largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both
        next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica
        of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance
        and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second
        only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others,
        a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio
        by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of
        Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del
        Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian
        Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo
        Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian
        Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]],
        and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic

        with the copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]].}}\n\nMany of
        the famous city''s squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with
        [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got
        their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones
        are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de'' Fiori]],
        [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon,
        Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]].
        One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana
        di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque
        palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]]
        and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of
        Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano
        Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn
        1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom
        of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]],
        a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]],
        became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]].
        During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to
        host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known
        symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument
        of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument
        to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that
        represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist
        architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome)
        (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See
        also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between
        1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction
        of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches
        and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his
        government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti,
        later renamed Via del''Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via
        del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\"
        of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore;
        [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most
        modern movements, such as the [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]].
        Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\",
        characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important
        construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]],
        by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome
        is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]].
        This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento
        architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally
        conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]],
        and was called \"E.42\" (''''\"Esposizione 42\"''''). The most representative
        buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943),
        the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum,
        and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world
        exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World
        War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during
        the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later
        abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities
        found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of
        the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and
        [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current
        seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign
        Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The
        [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main article|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic
        parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one

        part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and
        landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks
        surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late
        19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese
        gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa
        Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}.
        Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]],
        with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area
        of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell''Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto
        Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman
        hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees,
        but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden (''roseto comunale'').
        Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding
        the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large
        green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking
        [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]]
        and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]],
        near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin
        including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There
        are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains

        is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles,
        from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had
        [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking
        water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]],
        in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was
        named ''''curator aquarum'''' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had
        nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains
        and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household,
        baths and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected
        to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin,
        Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal,
        Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d''\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring
        the 17th and 18th century the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman
        aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching
        the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings
        of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque
        art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and
        movement. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and
        the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like
        baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".<ref>''''Italian

        is well known for its statues but, in particular, the [[talking statues of
        Rome]]. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes
        for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically)
        voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]]
        and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]],
        [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues
        are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods,
        ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]],
        Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]],
        [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]],
        and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not
        representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered
        with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view.
        Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include
        those of the Ponte Sant''Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the
        city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de''Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks

        article|Catacombs of Rome}}\nRome has extensive amount of ancient catacombs,
        or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at
        least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for
        Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish
        burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale
        catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were
        carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries
        of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits.
        Currently maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]]
        which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the
        Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nBeing
        the capital city of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the
        nation, like the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single
        Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives
        of all the countries for the states of Italy and the Vatican City (curiously,
        Rome also hosts, in the Italian part of its territory, the Embassy of Italy
        for the Vatican City, a unique case of an Embassy within the boundaries of

        to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Sistine Chapel|papal chapel]], though
        they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with
        the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] of composers, a concurrent
        movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer
        of the Roman School is [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], whose name has

        example of Roman-Jewish cuisine]]\n\n{{Main article|Roman cuisine}}\nRome''s
        cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and
        political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient
        Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient
        Greek culture, and after, the empire''s enormous expansion exposed Romans
        to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during
        the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since
        some of the best chefs of the time, worked for the popes. An example of this
        could be [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef, working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius
        IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook
        ''''Opera dell''arte del cucinare'''' was published. In the book he lists
        approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking
        techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref name=\"Rolland_1\">{{Harv|Rolland|2006|p=273}}.</ref>
        <br> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based
        on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables
        ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>Piras, 291.</ref> In parallel,
        Roman Jews -present in the city since the 1st century BC- developed their
        own cuisine, the ''''cucina giudaico-romanesca''''. Examples of Roman dishes
        include \"''''[[Saltimbocca]] alla Romana''''\" \u2013 a veal cutlet, Roman-style;
        topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; \"''''[[Carciofi
        alla romana]]''''\" \u2013 artichokes Roman-style; outer leaves removed, stuffed
        with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; \"''''[[Carciofi alla giudia]]''''\"
        \u2013 artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking; outer
        leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; \"''''[[Carbonara|Spaghetti

        the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe
        and the centre of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian cinema]], where a large number
        of today''s biggest box office hits are filmed. The {{convert|99|acre|ha|adj=on}}
        studio complex is {{convert|9.0|km|mi}} from the centre of Rome and is part
        of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to
        [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], with well over 5,000 professionals
        \u2013 from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than
        3,000 productions have been made on its lot, from recent features like ''''[[The
        Passion of the Christ]]'''', ''''[[Gangs of New York]]'''', [[Rome (TV series)|HBO''s
        ''''Rome'''']], ''''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou|The Life Aquatic]]''''

        cinema classics as ''''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'''', ''''[[Cleopatra

        in 1937 by [[Benito Mussolini]], the studios were bombed by the [[Allies of
        World War II|Western Allies]] during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0
        was the filming location for several large American film productions, and
        subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]].
        Today Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production,
        production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors
        and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed
        film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main article|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI
        Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, in the [[National
        Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome
        was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity [[Sabine]] tribes shared the
        area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one
        of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along
        with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings
        who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla,
        or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been
        a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius''
        entry on Claudius.  However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main
        language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents,
        ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated
        Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population
        in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during
        the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''''volgare''''\". The latter emerged
        as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan
        dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own
        dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''''Romanesco'''' spoken
        during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close
        to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]]
        culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome
        of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope
        Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift
        in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained
        largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other
        zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others),
        from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of
        Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education
        and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard
        Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes
        the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most
        important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]].
        It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''''lingua vernacola''''\"  (vernacular
        language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but
        it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly
        represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo
        Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi
        Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome''s historic contribution to language
        in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of
        [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]],
        the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly
        from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural
        influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because
        of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary
        from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is
        the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number
        of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin. London:
        HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign
        resident communities and a large number of foreign religious students or pilgrims
        and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism,
        many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is
        widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants
        and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio

        took place in the [[Stadio Olimpico|Olympic Stadium]], which is also the shared
        home stadium for local [[Serie A]] clubs [[S.S. Lazio]], founded in 1900,
        and [[A.S. Roma]], founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the [[Derby della Capitale]]

        and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been
        the case with players such as [[Francesco Totti]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]]
        (both for A.S. Roma), and [[Alessandro Nesta]] (for S.S. Lazio).\n[[Atletico
        Roma]] is a minor team that played in [[Lega Pro Prima Divisione|First Division]]

        using many ancient sites such as the [[Villa Borghese]] and the [[Baths of
        Caracalla|Thermae of Caracalla]] as venues. For the Olympic Games many new
        structures were created, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was
        also enlarged and renewed to host qualification and the final match of the
        [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]), the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created
        to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district),
        ecc. Rome made a [[Rome bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics|bid]] to host the
        [[2020 Summer Olympics]] but it was withdrawn before the deadline for applicant

        and is home to the internationally recognized basketball team [[Pallacanestro
        Virtus Roma|Virtus Roma]]. [[Rugby union]] is gaining wider acceptance.\nUntil
        2011 the [[Stadio Flaminio]] was the home stadium for the [[Italy national
        rugby union team]], which has been playing in the [[Six Nations Championship]]
        since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the
        Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity
        and safety. \nRome is home to local rugby union teams such as [[Rugby Roma
        Olimpic|Rugby Roma]] (founded in 1930 and winner of five Italian championships,
        the latter in 1999\u20132000), [[Unione Rugby Capitolina]] and [[S.S. Lazio
        Rugby 1927|S.S. Lazio 1927]] (rugby union branch of the multisport club [[S.S.
        Lazio]]).\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000|ATP Masters
        Series]] tennis tournament on the clay courts of the [[Foro Italico]]. Cycling
        was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded.
        Rome has hosted the final portion of the [[Giro d''Italia]] three times, in
        1911, 1950, and 2009. Rome is also home to other sports teams, including volleyball
        ([[M. Roma Volley]]), [[team handball|handball]] or [[water polo|waterpolo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{Main

        that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the
        [[Capitoline Hill]] and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled,
        at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the Capitol, by
        the ring-road (the ''''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'''' or ''''GRA'''').\n\nDue
        to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal
        railway node for central Italy. Rome''s main railway station, [[Roma Termini
        railway station|Termini]], is one of the largest railway stations in Europe
        and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing
        through every day. The second-largest station in the city, [[Roma Tiburtina
        railway station|Roma Tiburtina]], has been redeveloped as a [[High-speed rail

        The intercontinental [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport|Leonardo da Vinci
        International Airport]] is Italy''s chief airport, is located within the nearby
        [[Fiumicino]], south-west of Rome. The older [[Rome Ciampino Airport]] is
        a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino
        Airport\", as it is located beside [[Ciampino]], south-east of Rome. A third
        airport, the [[Roma-Urbe]] Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located
        about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the city centre, which handles most
        helicopter and private flights.\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on
        the Mediterranean Sea ([[Lido di Ostia]]), this has only a marina and a small
        channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port
        of Civitavecchia]], located about {{convert|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of
        the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porti di Roma|url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/|accessdate=6
        March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to
        this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily
        from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into
        the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped
        by the limited size of Rome''s metro system when compared to other cities
        of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants,
        far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome

        Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions
        being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of
        daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic
        Zones (''''Zona a Traffico Limitato'''' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently,
        heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere
        San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those
        districts.\n\n[[File:Roma Metropolitana e Ferrovia 2012.png|thumb|Roma Metrorail
        and Underground 2016]]\n[[File:Inaugurazione metro B1.jpg|thumb|[[Conca d''Oro
        (Rome Metro)|Conca d''Oro]] metro station]]\nA 3-line metro system called
        the ''''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'''' operates in Rome. Construction on
        the first branch started in the 1930s. The line had been planned to quickly
        connect the [[Roma Termini railway station|main railway station]] with the
        newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where the 1942 [[Esposizione
        universale (1942)|World Fair]] was supposed to be held. The event never took
        place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed
        [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome
        Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district.
        The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B
        Line.\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later
        extended in stages (1999\u20132000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension
        of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network
        is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times
        and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.\n\nThe
        A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line
        (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of \u20ac500&nbsp;million.
        B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance
        of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA third line, the C line, is under
        construction with an estimated cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion and will have
        30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. It will partly
        replace the existing [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini]]-Pantano rail
        line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom

        The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often
        delay underground construction work.\n\nA fourth line, D line, is also planned.
        It will have 22 stations over a distance of {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.
        The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before
        2035, but due to the city''s financial crisis the project has been put on
        hold.\n\nAbove-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and
        urban train network (FR lines). The bus, tram, metro and urban railways network
        is run by ''''Atac S.p.A.'''' (which originally stood for the Municipal Bus
        and Tramways Company, ''''Azienda Tramvie e Autobus del Comune'''' in Italian).
        The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus
        stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has {{convert|39|km|0|abbr=on}}
        of track and 192 stops.<ref>The figures are from the ATAC [http://www.atac.roma.it/index.asp?p=2&i=616&o=3&m=1&a=7&ci=45&tpg=2&lingua=ITA

        Headquarters in Rome.jpg|thumb|[[World Food Programme|WFP]] headquarters in
        Rome]]\n\nAmong the [[global cities]], Rome is unique in having two sovereign
        entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented
        by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller [[Sovereign Military
        Order of Malta]]. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]]
        and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]] which is the Diocese of Rome
        and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome therefore
        hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See,  to the  [[Sovereign
        Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organizations.
        Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in
        Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop
        of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]]
        (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''''[[ex officio]]''''
        the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by
        the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another
        body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome
        in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes
        classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome
        or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome
        is the seat of the so-called ''''''Polo Romano''''''<ref>[http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf
        parlamento.it]</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United
        Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food
        Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]
        (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European
        political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo
        della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry
        of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary
        of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of
        Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]]
        (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official
        signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European
        Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic
        Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where
        the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International
        Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe
        city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]]
        (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International
        Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property)
        and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private
        Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

        Fitzgerald Kennedy''''''  (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963), commonly
        referred to by his initials ''''''JFK'''''', was an American statesman who
        served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th President of
        the United States]] from January 1961 until [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|his
        assassination]] in November 1963. Kennedy served at the height of the [[Cold
        War]], and much of his presidency focused on managing relations with the [[Soviet
        Union]]. He was a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic
        Party]] who represented [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States House of
        Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate]] prior to becoming president.\n\nKennedy
        was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], to [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]] and
        [[Rose Kennedy]]. A scion of the [[Kennedy family]], he graduated from [[Harvard
        University]] in 1940 before joining the [[United States Navy Reserve|United
        States Naval Reserve]] the following year. During [[World War II]], Kennedy
        commanded a series of [[PT boat]]s in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]]
        and earned the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for his service. After the
        war, Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts''s 11th congressional district]]
        in the United States House of Representatives from 1947 until 1953. He was
        subsequently elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] and served
        as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960. While serving
        in the Senate, he published ''''[[Profiles in Courage]]'''', which won the
        [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography]]. In the [[United States Presidential Election,
        1960|1960 presidential election]], Kennedy narrowly defeated [[Republican
        Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent [[Richard Nixon]], who was the
        incumbent Vice President.\n\nKennedy''s time in office was marked by high
        tensions with [[Communist states]] in the Cold War. He increased the number
        of American military advisers in [[South Vietnam]] by a factor of 18 over
        President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. In April 1961, he authorized a failed
        joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the [[Cuba]]n government of [[Fidel Castro]]
        in the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>de Quesada, Alejandro ''''The Bay of
        Pigs\nCuba 1961'''' (2011) p. 17</ref> He subsequently rejected plans by the
        Joint Chiefs of Staff to [[Operation Northwoods|orchestrate false-flag attacks]]
        on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba.
        In October 1962, U.S. spy planes discovered that Soviet missile bases had
        been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the [[Cuban
        Missile Crisis]], nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear
        conflict. Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the [[Peace
        Corps]] and supported the [[Civil Rights Movement]], but he was largely unsuccessful
        in passing his [[New Frontier]] domestic policies. Kennedy continues to rank
        highly in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|historians''
        polls of U.S. presidents]] and with the general public. His average approval
        rating of 70% is the highest of any president in [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]''s
        history of systematically measuring job approval.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/165902/americans-rate-jfk-top-modern-president.aspx

        F. Kennedy|was assassinated]] in [[Dallas]], Texas. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]
        was arrested for the state crime, but he was never prosecuted due to his murder
        by [[Jack Ruby]] two days later. Pursuant to the [[United States presidential
        line of succession|Presidential Succession Act]], [[Vice President of the
        United States|Vice President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was sworn in as president
        later that day. The [[FBI]] and the [[Warren Commission]] officially concluded
        that Oswald was the lone assassin, but various groups challenged the findings
        of the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a [[John
        F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy]]. After Kennedy''s
        death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the [[Civil Rights
        Act of 1964]]  and the [[Revenue Act of 1964]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early

        had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures
        were concentrated on [[Wall Street]] and Hollywood. In September 1927, the

        Kennedy attended [[Choate Rosemary Hall|Choate]], a boarding school in [[Wallingford,
        Connecticut]], for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother Joe Jr. had already
        been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student.
        He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother''s shadow, and compensated
        with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. They carried out their
        most notorious stunt by exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker.
        In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished
        the toilet seat and spoke of certain \"muckers\" who would \"spit in our sea\".
        The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group \"The Muckers Club\",
        which included roommate and friend [[Lem Billings|Kirk LeMoyne \"Lem\" Billings]].{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=11}}\n\nDuring
        his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated
        with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at [[Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital|New

        the Senate voted to censure McCarthy and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting
        the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized
        at the time. The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position
        of participating procedurally by \"pairing\" his vote against that of another
        senator. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode
        damaged his support among members of the [[Modern liberalism in the United

        January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the [[Democratic Party
        (United States) presidential primaries, 1960|Democratic presidential nomination]].
        Though some questioned Kennedy''s youth and experience, his charisma and eloquence
        earned him numerous supporters. His greatest obstacle to winning the nomination
        may have been his religion. Many Americans held [[Anti-Catholicism in the
        United States|anti-Catholic attitudes]], but his vocal support of the [[separation
        of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]
        helped to defuse the issue. His religion also helped him win a devoted following
        among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for
        the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]],
        Adlai Stevenson, and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Kennedy traveled extensively
        to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party
        officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries,
        and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning
        the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary,
        effectively ending Humphrey''s hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless,
        Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary
        in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin.
        Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at
        the start of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], it was unclear whether
        he would win the nomination.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38\u201345}}\n\n[[File:Kennedy

        Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough
        to ensure he would win the nomination. Stevenson\u2014the 1952 and 1956 presidential
        nominee\u2014remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped
        to win the nomination with the support of party leaders. Kennedy''s candidacy
        also faced opposition from former president [[Harry S. Truman]], who worried
        about Kennedy''s lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could
        result in the nomination of Johnson or another candidate, and his well-organized
        campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the
        presidential nomination on the first ballot.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=45\u201347}}
        Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother and some of his liberal supporters

        Johnson as his vice presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator
        could help him win support in the [[Southern United States|South]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|p=47}}
        In accepting the presidential nomination, Kennedy gave his well-known \"[[New

        to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy

        John F. Kennedy during his presidency]]\n\nPresident Kennedy''s foreign policy
        was dominated by American confrontations with the [[Soviet Union]], manifested
        by proxy contests in the early stage of the [[Cold War]]. In 1961, Kennedy
        anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]]
        [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively
        to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The
        speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy
        interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions
        going into the [[Vienna summit|Vienna Summit]] of June 1961.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|pp=76\u201378}}\n[[File:President

        the first head of an independent [[Ghana]], March 1961]]\n\nOn the way to
        the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet [[Charles de Gaulle]], who advised
        him to ignore Khrushchev''s abrasive style. The French president feared the
        United States'' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was
        quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up
        on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as \"the
        man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=145}}\n\nOn
        June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings
        angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite
        the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with
        the president''s intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in
        conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before
        them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and [[East Berlin]]. He made it clear
        that any such treaty which interfered with U.S access rights in [[West Berlin]]
        would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013171}}\n\nShortly
        after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its intention to
        sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights
        in either sector of the city. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his
        only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally
        thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=175}}\n\nIn
        the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled
        from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the
        USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where [[Dean Acheson]]
        took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}}
        In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&nbsp;billion
        to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating
        that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The
        speech received an 85% approval rating.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}}\n\n[[File:John
        F. Kennedy and Amintore Fanfani.jpg|thumb|left|Kennedy with the Italian Prime
        Minister [[Amintore Fanfani]], at the [[White House]], in 1963]]\nThe following
        month, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage
        of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the
        city, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]]. Kennedy''s initial
        reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin
        continued. This course was altered when it was learned that West Berliners
        had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States.
        Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel,
        in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate
        the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}}\n\nKennedy
        gave a speech at [[Saint Anselm College]] on May 5, 1960, regarding America''s
        conduct in the emerging Cold War. The address detailed how American foreign
        policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support

        a leisurely stroll on the White House grounds]]\nThe prior Eisenhower administration
        had created a plan to overthrow [[Fidel Castro]]''s regime in Cuba. The plan,
        led by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), with help from the U.S.
        military, was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency
        composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=233,
        238}}<ref>Gleijeses (1995), pp. 9\u201319</ref> led by CIA paramilitary officers.
        The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban
        people in hopes of removing Castro from power.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=69\u201373}}
        Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.\n\nThe [[Bay of
        Pigs Invasion]] began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans,
        called [[Brigade 2506]], landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided.
        [[Allen Welsh Dulles|Allen Dulles]], [[director of the CIA]], later stated
        that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success
        once the troops were on the ground.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=71, 673}}\n\nBy April
        19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles,
        and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors.
        After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53&nbsp;million
        worth of food and medicine.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=268\u2013294, 838\u2013839}}
        The incident made Castro wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another
        invasion would occur.<ref>[[Jean Edward Smith]], \"Bay of Pigs: The Unanswered
        Questions\", ''''The Nation'''', April 13, 1964.</ref>\n\nAccording to biographer
        [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]], Kennedy focused primarily
        on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations.
        When it failed, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look
        bad.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=95\u201397}} He took responsibility for the failure,
        saying: \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we''ll
        learn something from it.\"{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=290, 295}}\n\nIn late
        1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert
        Kennedy and including [[Edward Lansdale]], Secretary [[Robert McNamara]],
        and others. The group''s objective\u2014to overthrow Castro via espionage,
        sabotage, and other covert tactics\u2014was never pursued.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=264}}\n\n====Cuban

        U-2|U-2]] spy planes took photographs of intermediate-range ballistic missile
        sites being built in Cuba by the Soviets. The photos were shown to Kennedy
        on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in
        nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}\n\nKennedy
        faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to [[nuclear
        warfare|nuclear war]] with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would
        be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S.
        would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere.
        On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev,
        especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}}\n\n{{listen |

        National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) favored an unannounced

        image of \"[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in reverse\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=387}}
        There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence),
        that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that [[PGM-19
        Jupiter]] missiles had been placed in Italy and Turkey by Eisenhower in 1958.
        There could also be no assurance that the assault would be 100% effective.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=388}}
        In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval
        quarantine. On October 22 he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced
        the decision on TV.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=389}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and
        inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The [[Organization
        of American States]] gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles.
        The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=390}}
        [[United Nations]] (UN) Secretary General [[U Thant]] requested that both
        parties reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev
        agreed, Kennedy did not.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=403}}\n\nOne Soviet-flagged ship
        was stopped and boarded. On October 28 Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the
        missile sites, subject to UN inspections.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=426}} The U.S.
        publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its
        Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had
        been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184\u2013186}}\n\nThis

        The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president''s credibility.

        took office, the Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating
        plans for the assassination of Castro in Cuba and [[Rafael Trujillo]] in the

        [[Roger Hilsman]], then director of the State Department''s [[Bureau of Intelligence

        Robert Thompson]], head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam and
        the [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] was formed. It was approved by Kennedy and
        South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. It was implemented in early 1962
        and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of
        rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated
        from Communist insurgents. It was hoped that these new communities would provide
        security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central
        government. By November 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964.{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=1070}}\n\nIn

        throughout Washington to \"destroy all coup cables\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=577}}
        At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed
        by U.S. clergy from the Ministers'' Vietnam Committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=560}}\n\nA
        White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals;
        the president was given updated assessments after [[Krulak Mendenhall mission|personal
        inspections on the ground]] by the Department of Defense (General [[Victor
        Krulak]]) and the State Department ([[Joseph Mendenhall]]). Krulak said that
        the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while
        Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence.
        Kennedy reacted, saying: \"Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?\"
        The president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had
        not spoken to each other on the return flight.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=595}}\n\nIn
        October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General
        [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] to a Vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize
        the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the [[McNamara
        Taylor mission]] \"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the
        differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=602}}
        In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree
        to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara''s previous optimism about
        Diem.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=609}} Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam''s
        vice president, [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]] (choice of many to succeed Diem), who
        in detailed terms obliterated Taylor''s information that the military was
        succeeding in the countryside.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=610}} At Kennedy''s insistence,
        the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals:
        1,000 by year''s end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered
        a strategic fantasy.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=613}}\n\nIn late October, intelligence
        wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The
        source, Vietnamese General [[Duong Van Minh]] (also known as \"Big Minh\"),
        wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert
        assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=617}}
        On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by \"Big Minh\", [[1963
        South Vietnamese coup|overthrew the Diem government]], arresting [[Arrest
        and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|and then killing Diem and Nhu]]. Kennedy
        was shocked by the deaths.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=650}}\n\nNews of the coup led
        to renewed confidence initially\u2014both in America and in South Vietnam\u2014that
        the war might be won.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=651}} [[McGeorge Bundy]] drafted
        a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from
        Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing
        military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia.
        Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told [[Michael Forrestal]] that \"after
        the first of the year&nbsp;... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible
        option, including how to get out of there&nbsp;... to review this whole thing

        from leaving us.\" The speech is known for its famous phrase ''''\"[[Ich bin

        1960, Kennedy stated: \"Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of

        of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli
        military alliance (which would be continued under subsequent presidents).
        Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations
        had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and
        national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a ''special
        relationship'' (as he described it to [[Golda Meir]]) between the US and Israel.<ref>{{cite

        with [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Israeli Foreign Minister]] [[Golda
        Meir]], December 27, 1962]]\n\nKennedy extended the first informal security
        guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president
        to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (the [[MIM-23 Hawk]]),
        as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies which were opposed
        by Arab neighbors; such as its water project on the [[Jordan River]].<ref>Walt,
        Stephen M. (1987). ''''The Origins of Alliances'''', Cornell University Press,
        pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\nAs result of this newly created security alliance,
        Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government over the production
        of nuclear materials in [[Dimona]] which he believed could instigate a nuclear
        arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially
        denied by the Israeli government, [[David Ben-Gurion]] stated in a speech
        to the Israeli [[Knesset]] on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear
        plant at [[Beersheba]] was for \"research in problems of arid zones and desert
        flora and fauna.\"{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}} When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy
        in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear
        power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes \"for the time being.\"{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}}\n\nIn
        a May 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion, Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated
        that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information
        on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, Ben-Gurion repeated previous
        reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. The Israeli
        government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to [[International
        Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspections. In 1962, the US and Israeli governments
        had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attach\u00e9 at the embassy
        in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down
        temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}}\n\nAccording
        to [[Seymour Hersh]], the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the
        Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated: \"It was part of my job to
        tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on [an inspection].\"{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}}
        Hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it \"guaranteed
        that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president
        and his senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would
        have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence
        of Israel.\"<ref>Hersh, ''''Samson Option'''', pp. 110\u201311</ref> [[Marc
        Trachtenberg]] argued: \"Although well aware of what the Israelis were doing,
        Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance

        the State Department''s Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March
        1965 that Israel was developing [[nuclear weapons]]. He reported that Israel''s
        target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968\u20131969.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=203}}
        On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] told President
        Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a
        year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept
        international supervision of its nuclear program.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Dimona
        was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence
        to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) into contracts for the supply
        of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.{{sfn|Salt|2008|pp=201\u2013205}}\n\n====Iraq====\n{{Main

        between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow

        of a republican government led by Brigadier [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]].{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=3-5}}
        On June 25, 1961, Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and
        [[Kuwait]], declaring the latter nation \"an indivisible part of Iraq\" and
        causing a short-lived \"Kuwait Crisis\". The United Kingdom\u2014which had
        just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was heavily
        dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops
        to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched
        a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the UK (at the urging of the Kennedy
        administration) brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where
        the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was
        resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by
        a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}\n\nIn December
        1961, Qasim''s government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the British-
        and American-owned [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)''s [[Concession (contract)|concessionary
        holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively
        expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by
        the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored
        UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which
        they believed to be connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert
        Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might
        \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production),
        or \"throw himself into Russian arms.\" Komer also made note of widespread
        rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the
        potential to \"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel.\"{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37,
        40-42}}\n\nIn April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq
        that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy
        instructed the CIA\u2014under the direction of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt
        Jr.]]\u2014to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=43-45}}\n\nThe

        Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent
        rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the
        testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American
        involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement
        for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba''athist
        coup plot.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=45, 57-58}} The Kennedy administration was
        pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for

        article|Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty}}\n\nTroubled by the long-term dangers
        of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons
        proliferation]], Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test
        ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson''s 1956 presidential campaign.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=552}}
        In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy reached
        an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began
        testing nuclear weapons that September. The United States responded by conducting
        tests five days later.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Shortly thereafter, new U.S.
        satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were
        substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=229}} Nevertheless,
        the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the
        U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}}\n\nIn
        July 1963, Kennedy sent [[W. Averell Harriman]] to Moscow to negotiate a treaty
        with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} The introductory sessions included
        Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to [[Andrei Gromyko]].
        It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented,
        due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would
        verify compliance.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=548}}\n\nUltimately, the United States,
        the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a
        limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere,
        or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate ratified this and Kennedy
        signed it into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that it was
        free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=550}}\n\n===Domestic

        federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid
        to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. Kennedy
        also promised an end to [[racial discrimination]],<ref name=\"Jaikumar 2011\">{{cite

        and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20\u201390%
        to a range of 14\u201365%; he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates
        from 52 to 47%. Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain
        deductions were not eliminated for high income earners.<ref name=\"Jaikumar

        revenue in the long term is to lower rates now.\"{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=453}}
        Congress passed few of Kennedy''s major programs during his lifetime, but
        did vote them through in 1964 and 1965 under his successor Johnson.{{sfn|Barnes|2007|p=8}}\n\n====Economy====\nKennedy
        ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep
        [[interest rate]]s down and to encourage growth of the economy.{{sfn|Frum|2000|p=293}}
        He presided over the first government budget to top the $100&nbsp;billion

        The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years, and was
        in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably during his presidency.
        Despite low inflation and interest rates, [[GDP]] had grown by an average
        of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower presidency (scarcely more than

        discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s.
        [[Jim Crow]] [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] was the
        established law in the [[Deep South]].<ref name=Grantham_p156>Grantham (1988),
        ''''The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History'''', p. 156</ref>
        The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] had ruled in 1954 in ''''[[Brown
        v. Board of Education]]'''' that [[racial segregation]] in public schools
        was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not
        obey the Supreme Court''s decision. The Court also prohibited segregation
        at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms,
        bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.{{sfn|Dallek|2003|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nKennedy
        verbally supported [[racial integration]] and civil rights; during the 1960

        controlled congressional legislation.{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=487}} Historian Carl

        was concerned with other issues early in his presidency, such as the Cold
        War, Bay of Pigs fiasco and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated
        by brother Robert, the administration''s early priority was to \"keep the
        president out of this civil rights mess.\" Civil rights movement participants,

        integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly
        met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal

        meets with leaders of the [[March on Washington]] in the Oval Office, August
        28, 1963]]\nOver a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans, gathered
        in Washington for the civil rights [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]
        on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect
        on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation
        to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government''s involvement
        to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars
        to the six sponsors of the March, including the [[National Association for
        the Advancement of Colored People|N.A.A.C.P.]] and Martin Luther King''s [[Southern
        Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nTo
        ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally
        edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held
        on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00&nbsp;pm. Thousands of troops were
        placed on standby. Kennedy watched King''s speech on TV and was very impressed.
        The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest
        relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted
        an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken.
        Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the
        chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nNevertheless,
        the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later, [[16th Street Baptist Church

        Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children
        had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the
        aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599\u2013600}} Due to this resurgent violence,
        the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically
        endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president.
        Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following
        day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out
        of the House committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=628\u2013631}} Gaining Republican

        2002 [[Robert Dallek]] wrote an extensive history of Kennedy''s health. Dallek
        was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years
        1955\u20131963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of
        White House physician Dr. [[Janet Travell]]. According to Travell''s records,
        during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach,
        colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems.
        Travell kept a \"Medicine Administration Record,\" cataloguing Kennedy''s
        medications: \"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency;
        procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil,
        Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control
        his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other
        antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and [[Tuinal]]
        to help him sleep.\"<ref name = \"Dallek\"/>\n\nYears after Kennedy''s death,
        it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first
        term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at [[The London Clinic]]
        with [[Addison''s disease]], a rare endocrine disorder. In 1966 Dr. Travell
        revealed that Kennedy also had [[hypothyroidism]]. The presence of two endocrine
        diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had [[autoimmune polyendocrine
        syndrome type 2]] (APS 2).<ref name=\"Mandel, Lee R. 2009 350\u2013354\">{{cite

        for which he had surgery and was written up in the [[American Medical Association]]''s
        ''''Archives of Surgery''''. Kennedy''s condition may have had diplomatic
        repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to
        treat severe back pain during the 1961 [[Vienna Summit]] with Soviet Premier
        [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells,
        steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side
        effects included hyperactivity, [[hypertension]], impaired judgment, nervousness,
        and mood swings.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|p=213}} Kennedy at one time was regularly

        greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment
        on the political landscape.\n\nMany of Kennedy''s speeches (especially his
        inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short
        term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition
        during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents,

        primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John
        F. Kennedy''s assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before
        the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network
        television''s first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview
        with ''''[[CBS Evening News]]'''' anchor [[Walter Cronkite]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronkite|first=Walter|title=A

        F Kennedy 1967 Issue-13c.jpg|thumb|Kennedy on a U.S. postage stamp, issue
        of 1967]]\nNewspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated
        information. In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event
        of its kind. TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and
        creating memories of this space in time. All three major U.S. television networks
        suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November
        22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the
        longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.<ref>{{cite news

        }}</ref>\n\nThe assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the
        U.S. but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when they
        first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese
        [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, before it and the [[September
        11 attacks]] after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination:
        \"all of us..... will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours.\"
        Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall
        of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators,
        and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it
        has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s,
        especially the Vietnam War.\n\nUltimately, the death of President Kennedy,
        and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are
        of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point
        and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment\u2014a
        point made by commentators from [[Gore Vidal]] to [[Arthur M. Schlesinger,
        Jr.]] and implied by [[Oliver Stone]] in several of his films, such as his
        landmark 1991 [[JFK (film)|''''JFK'''']].\n\n===Memorials and eponyms===\n{{main

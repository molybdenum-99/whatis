        are [[carnivora]]n [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] ''''''Ursidae''''''.
        They are classified as [[caniformia|caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans. Although
        only eight [[species]] of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing
        in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and
        partially in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Bears are found on the [[continent]]s
        of [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]]. Common
        characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long
        snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile
        claws, and short tails.\n\nWhile the [[polar bear]] is mostly [[carnivore|carnivorous]],
        and the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], the remaining
        six species are [[omnivore|omnivorous]] with varied diets. With the exception
        of [[courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically
        [[solitary animals]]. They may be [[diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]]
        and have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Despite their heavy build
        and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use
        shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their
        dens during the winter for a long period of [[hibernation]], up to 100 days.\n\nBears
        have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for [[bear meat|their meat]]
        and fur; they have been used for [[bear-baiting]] and other forms of entertainment,
        such as being [[tame bear|made to dance]]. With their powerful physical presence,
        they play a prominent role in [[the arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural
        aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under
        pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear
        parts, including the Asian [[bile bear]] market. The [[World Conservation
        Union|IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or
        [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species, such
        as the [[brown bear]], are at risk of [[Local extinction|extirpation]] in
        certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened
        populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English
        word \"bear\" comes from [[Old English]] ''''{{lang|ang|bera}}'''' and belongs
        to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]], such as Swedish
        ''''{{lang|sv|[[bjorn|bj\u00f6rn]]}}'''', also used as a first name, that
        originate from an adjective meaning \"brown\".<!--<ref name=\"indo-european1959\">{{cite

        Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: [[Ailuropodinae]]
        (monotypic with the [[giant panda]]), [[Tremarctinae]] (monotypic with the
        [[spectacled bear]]), and [[Ursinae]] (containing six species divided into
        one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis
        show that the [[karyotype]] of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with
        each having 74 [[chromosome]]s, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes
        and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the
        fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those
        of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports
        the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in [[Procyonidae]],
        where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.<ref name=Servheen1999>{{cite

        [[Oligocene]], 34\u201330 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked
        very different from today''s bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall
        appearance, and diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. ''''Parictis''''

        faunal exchange across the [[Bering land bridge]] may have been possible during

        survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation
        event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of
        termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3\u20134 Mya,
        the species ''''Ursus minimus'''' appears in the fossil record of Europe;
        apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today''s [[Asian black bear]].
        It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the
        sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from ''''U. minimus'''': the black bears
        (including the [[sun bear]], the Asian black bear, and the [[American black
        bear]]); and the brown bears (which includes the [[polar bear]]). Modern [[brown
        bear]]s evolved from ''''U. minimus'''' via ''''[[Ursus etruscus]]'''', which
        itself is ancestral to the extinct [[Pleistocene]] [[cave bear]]. Species
        of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early
        as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved
        species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.<ref name=Qiu>{{cite

        Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison
        to smaller species.<ref name=Hunt98/> Relying as they do on strength rather
        than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support
        their bulk. The [[Scapula|shoulder blades]] and the [[pelvis]] are correspondingly
        massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the [[big cat]]s as there
        is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their
        gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig
        out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to
        club large creatures.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/>\n\n[[File:Black bear
        large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and
        sit as humans do.]]\nUnlike most other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]].
        They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering
        when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as
        a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their
        hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are
        flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears'' non-retractable claws are
        used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front
        feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing
        trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest
        claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front
        feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping [[bamboo]] shoots as
        the animals feed.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/>\n\nMost mammals have [[Agouti
        (coloration)|agouti]] hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of
        colour corresponding to two different types of [[melanin]] pigment. Bears
        however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout
        their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The
        coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering,
        and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to
        the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation
        and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have
        hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it
        to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra
        insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.<ref name=\"Marshall
        Cavendish\"/> Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears
        tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the
        chest or face.<ref name=\"Ward124\"/>\n\nBears have small rounded ears so
        as to minimise heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly
        acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have [[colour vision]], perhaps
        to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans
        in not having touch-sensitive [[whiskers]] on the muzzle; however, they have
        an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], better than that of the [[dog]],
        or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other
